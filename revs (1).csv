"We were served by Katie at Vodafone Priory Shopping Centre Hastings.She was extremely helpful and managed to renew our contract by reducing our monthly payments by 50%. Katie handled everything from A to Z and explained to us all the options and terms and conditions.  Honestly, she was the best I have ever seen in any a customer services business. She is a great asset to Vodafone."
"I've signed a new broadband plan and ordered a router on 1 April. The router was sent and delivered to the wrong address on 19 April and even though I've contacted the customer service multiple times, it's been almost a month and I am still without a router. Had to get extra cellular data because I didn't have a broadband. I planning on cancelling my contract at this point."
Just spoke to a rep on vodaphone Due to the current situation and becoming a pensioner I have asked vodaphone to help me with my contract.I am struggling to even eat at this time I don't get benefits just a state pension. You would think that a company that has made so much money this year could help someone in my position. Tried to contact  the team you stated after 3 attempts the person I chatted with did not know what trust pilot was !
Tried to upgrade but it is now impossible to actually speak to someone . You call and tell an automated system what your issue is then put into a chat room . 36 people waiting before me . Then you eventually start chatting and it takes forever to get anywhere . I now want tocancel my contract and again can’t speak to anyone . Appalling service anyone
"Vodafone are the most incompetent, unprofessional organisation I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with. They don't read chat messages, ask the same questions repeatedly, pass you on to the wrong team. Don't call back to complete opening of a business account, despite having ALL the information. I spent over 75 minutes on a chat with them on Monday and am more than an hour in today and still do not have an account open. Absolutely shocking."
"I cancelled my direct debit, because I cancelled my broadband and you still charged me then would not refund me, leaving me with out money. Then you did it again months later,when I paid my bill at the bank , took another payment. Refusing to refund me. Stop helping your self to what money I do get. You lie and are  a shocking company"
"Lila was an amazing glamorous sales assistant, lovely personality, very helpful, couldn't do enough for me, she went through everything in detail for me & advised me on which phone was the best one for me, very efficient, a lovely person all round, i've been with Vodafone for about 20 years now & i would definitely recommend them."
Poor poor poor been with these over 15 years but that means nothing Tried. To upgrade but price way above other online company's Time to leave greedy vodafoneTried to cancel but nobody answers they sent you to automatic service I'm number 41 in queue how ridiculous this company want top money for terrible service definitely leaving you should do sameQuick update impossible to cancel contract you have to just cancel your direct debit disgraceful company same as virgin media
"Very poor listening and communication skills, Issue has not been resolved. I have been robbed, not been able to connect to internet on and off for 4 months with my two numbers. Now I have been restricted not been able to use phone calls texts or internet on my home broadband what I have paid for because of a £28 bill for mobile broadband which I do not owe as I am meant to get £350 credit for very poor internet service which hasn’t been applied. I have now been cut off  Bully's"
Dreadful customer service. Been waiting more than 6 weeks for them to respond to my complaint. I only asked them to relocate my contact to my new address but they upgraded me instead to a contact that was more than double the original price. They also sent the router to my old address. Do not use this company
"Sergiu, Keanu, and Mo who is the store manager offered me a great and lively customer service. I needed a new phone as my old phone was broken. Keanu was fast with the service delivery, and the other guys were ready to offer all the help one may need at the Vodafone shop. Great customer service overall...."
"I needed help to sort out my phone. Nathan was so helpful and has advised me before, that's why I came back to see him again today. He is very knowledgeable and can help with technical questions that I don't understand. Both Nathan and colleague have been so pleasant, reassuring and fixed my problem."
"I have used Superfast Broadband, for several years, however, nowadays it’s become poor quality (line) fails often, and the customer service is appalling. It’s quite difficult to communicate, when overseas call centre staff, have a general poor grasp of English language, and the problem solving skills, are non existent. I won’t continue with my contract, purely based upon tech help and customer service. It didn’t help either, that as an existing customer, I cannot gain a new deal, at half the price, that I pay, for new customers."
I had an issue with my mobile phone settings and was struggling to get my phone to work properly. I spoke to a sales advisor in your Banbury store who updated it for me and showed me what to do in the future. Really helpful staff and took the time to sit and explain things to me!
"Terrible just terrible !I have 2 phones with Vodafone for my daughters, ive never received a statement for either, tried to login online but cannot use the same email address to receive both statements. They cannot send them to me either ? To find this out took an hour on the phone and I just told the call handler that I give up its to difficult to get a basic thing done and politely hung up. Unbelievable in 2023 that Vodafone cannot do this very basic task. I now put them in the same category as BT totally incompetent !! I will be moving back to EE as soon as the contracts are up. BE WARNED !"
Natasha at crystal peaks who served us was very knowledgeable and pleasant and gave me all the information I needed to switch broadband from plusnet to vodafoneI feel she should be rewarded for the knowledge she has and the kindness/ patience she has.
The Managers Mutahara and Ahmer!!!! What a team - absolutely fantastic Mutahara really knows her stuff and did the perfect deal for Broadband - such care and charisma and Ahmer was supreme with a New Sim Only plan - they fully set up my phone with no problems- sat with me and discussed the whole process on how operate it. Such fantastic service - Highly Recommend them and and St Albans Branch!!
"After making a hash of trying to buy/upgrade a mobile phone online, I went to the Crystal Peaks Vodafone store. The service from Craig was excellent, incredibly helpful, patient and tolerant of my mistake and sorted out the issue for me in a very calm, efficient and professional way. I would certainly recommend their service and go there again - before I try and do things myself next time."
"It was so easy to start using one of their big value bundles! But you try cancelling it, suddenly it's a merry-go-round of phoning this number, phoning that number, tapping in options, no options apply, listen to adverts, message their twitter account, hear the same story, we need your full name, date of birth, post code etc. etc. still no luck. I'm swapping to another network, ANY other network.Scammers - avoid!"
I was dealt with by the Store manager Alexandra and she was brilliant. She listened to what my requirements were and she tailor made everything based on my needs and usage. She went beyond her call of duty to make sure I was happy and understood all the terms. I can't fault her in any way shape or form. Brilliant customer service and genuine. Rarely seen these days if im being honest.Thank you Vodafone and thank you Alexandra once again.🙂
"***UPDATE***Contacted customer support as per the advice left by Vodafone on this review, no progress just that Vodafone deemed it acceptable to not keep to an appointment without notice or reason.*** ORIGINAL POST ***Everything has gone wrong. Have be waiting for installation since early March when I call for an update I’m told I will be given an answer tomorrow, 3 times I’ve been told this.Made a complaint, told I would receive a phone call today, no call. Called the number online chat gave me which just tells me to contact online chat so now left going round in circles as online won’t help as there is an open complaint."
"Very friendly, professional with excellent customer service oriented staff. Mo in particular ( a store manager) has been wonderful, he could easily solve any issue, extremely professional and helpful- definitely recommend this branch!!!!!!"
Vodafone Pet Curve tracker came off its flimsy rubber ring holder. Tracking not accurate enough to locate without dog attachment! Still tracking but no pinpoint accuracy. Now I find discontinued so cannot replace or purchase like for like. Chat help didn't help. Feel let down so now hassle cost of cxl SIM x researching new manufacturer etc. Broadband X Mobile phone customer paying £90 a month. Broadband renewal due next few months so will consider switching as who knows what Vodafone will cxl next. Just stung for 15% inflation increases on top. Will think now to join Sky who stick with the quoted price throughout contract when mobile contract ends.
"Took me over an hour to cancel my broadband. Only to be hit with gotcha's about 30 day cancellations and so now forced to be paying for a service 2 months after I disconnect it. Shameful practice rinsing their customers for every penny. Disgusted, avoid these charlatans. Will never go near Vodafone again."
Visited the Trafford centre store and was greeted by Chris then served by Dan. The store was busy but the feeling in store was really good and lots of smiling faces from customers and staff. Dan was great and really took time to understand my needs and got me the right product which I am delighted with.
"I needed help to sort out my phone. Nathan was so helpful and has advised me before, that's why I came back to see him again today. He is very knowledgeable and can help with technical questions that I don't understand. Both Nathan and colleague have been so pleasant, reassuring and fixed my problem."
"28.03.2023 Update!Still as I was months ago, no contact from Vodafone, no contact from the social media team, called myself again just to get the same answers and Vodafone not understand what to do, my reviews are genuine and they should honestly alert you to stay away as far as you can! I mean I can not even receive calls, I’ve not had any contact on both my lines to advise of my numbers, they lost my number which was my main business line and till date have not done nothing about it even though a gentlemen called LEE took it upon himself for the errors made by Vodafone and promised me to resolve and compensate the business number not being ported over!!!"
Dhiren the store manager went above and beyond to ensure I had a smooth change over from my old phone to new phone. Saved me money and got me a much better phone. Not pushy at all and would highly recommend. Great bunch of lads
"Would like to thank KI at the barnsley vodafone store for helping me today with my upgrade, talked me through everything and explained everything in detail made me feel so at ease, Ki went above and beyond! If ever I need help in future I will certainly pop into store to see Ki, thank you 😊"
"Jafar was extremely helpful during my visit. He provided me with extensive information concerning available plans, which are extremely attractive. I had never appreciated how much value for money is provided by Vodaphone. He is a very knowledgeable and helpful operative. Hugely appreciated."
"Amazing experience in Corby store today! We came every 2 years for upgrading and I never had such a good outcome. Andreea, the sales adviser was very knowledgeable and made us laugh! We stayed 3hrs and 30 minutes there because the atmosphere was so good🤣She deserves a salary raise🔝"
Went into shop today to purchase a new phone contract. My experience was absolutely excellent. Rado the store manager was excellent. I had to go back in as all my contacts didn't go over to new and Rado helped me again.
"Vodafone signal for the past few months has been rubbish, phone struggles to connect to 3g and 4g, when I finally do get a signal it's slow. Am on pay n go, when my data runs out sm getting shut of Vodafone. Its a load of b@llocks. No wonder they give you 40gb you can't use it."
"I had a really great experience thanks to everything Yaasiin did for me in the store. From setting me up with a great pay as you go plan upon arrival in the UK, to getting me a phone contract that’s as exactly what I needed. I’m so grateful I was able to work with him twice."
"Upgrade from dom in paignton. Amazing service, gave me a couple different options for upgrading and also spoke to me about adding an extra sim to my account for my son. Will be seeing him again when I next upgrade"
"Absolutely useless, never ever again.  Instead of understanding the busy nature of business users, Vodafone make the simplest of tasks extremely difficult and drawn out, presumably to stop you contacting them.  The broadband is completely unacceptable, often cutting out making our alarm system and till system lose connection constantly.  Impossible to speak to anyone about it unless you waste an hour speaking to their clown of a chatbot, who happens to be more useful than the staff who you can eventually get through to if you never give up, they have no interest in helping whatsoever."
"Vodaphone is a disgrace. They  avoid where ever possible answering concerns. For a communications company their communications are a joke. I have wasted a whole weekend and half of Monday and Tuesday trying to resolve THEIR mistake as to why they issued me(and I have been paying for) two contracts when I only have one phone! I have spoken to chat bots, humans, even have been talked through a way to resolve the issue by one of their advisors called Connor, The result? I now have no service at all, I cannot receive an OTP to check my online account. They are an absolute disgrace. I think I'll move to Giffgaff."
I had a problem with bvb pay as you go spoke to someone who couldn't help spoke to visshal who spent time chatting and gave 5star service thankyou to you as you said the problem wouldn't happen again so hopefully sorted thankyou kindly good staff :)
A very helpful young man helped with getting a sim only contract sorted after many years on phone/IPad contracts. The young man called Kyle was extremely knowledgeable regarding the process. Thank you
"Useless lying ****s!For months I have been begging for my old plan to disconnect. They keep telling me it will be done. Every month I am billed £30 extra for it, on top of my new plan!Money grabbing **stards! Additionally, I waited over a month for my new plan to start due to more incompetence!How hard can it be!?"
Would like to thank Chantelle and Ewan for their due diligence in spotting an error with my recent broadband deal that I was sold. Excellent service in identifying and putting right a costly problem.I can't thank Chantelle and team enough.
We went into the metro store and was served by Sohaib he was very helpful and was reassuring us with the hand over and getting to know the new phones Samsung 23 UltraWe even got a good trade in We left the store very happy Delphine
Ben and the Richard gave exceptional service today. Sorted an issue that have been a problem for a few months unable to send or receive text messages. Solved with  patience and friendly attitude.Many thanks for your support. Marie
I don't like them. Their shop would not help me to set up my new phone or move files from the old phone. The average rating of 3.1 is clearly incorrect. 78% of reviews are just one star!
"This is the second review i have written in 2 weeks because it would seem it is the only way to get through to Vodafone. Please would someone look at my Broadband account and contact me. I have rung you so many times and i keep being told you give me a call back but you just dont bother, in fact every time i ring someone lies to me . The last time one of your colleagues admitted that you had made a mess of my account but told me not to worry because you DEFINITELY wont take any money from me thru the Direct Debit and then you took £25. BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE IS NOT GOOD BUT WHEN YOU LIE TO ME ON EVERY SINGLE PHONECALL I HAVE WITH YOU THAT IS UNNACCEPTABLE. PLEASE CONTACT ME."
"I was served by Ashley today, who gave me a fantastic experience. He was more than happy to help and suggested many different options to me before I made a decision. Incredibly helpful and friendly! 10/10 customer service!"
Took out a £10 a month 7gb sim added credit. Moved my number. they started taking £1 a day for 50mb and didnt give me the bundle i brought. So i added credit £5 and they debited from account. Money didnt show up. So i added another £5 to get it up and still didnt show. 1 hour later one credit was added so i tried to buy the bundle £10 as had £14 showing.. Nope you cant use the credit you have they want to take ANOTHER £10 from my bank. Im already £20 into them. I've had 50mb which went in a few minutes. i cant get to speak to anyone. Absolutely terrible system/service. I wish i never gave them my money. My phones useless  now i have things to do and no data. Wish i stayed with BT.
Come to shop today and got the 14 pro 256 on installment. And the store  manager Mr Glenn is so friendly and supportive. He help me a lot..guys just come to the shop and talk to him he is really great and helpful guy..
Nesma from the customer care phone team very quickly settled my concerns. I called quite annoyed with a mistake made by my local store but was put at ease after speaking to Nesma. Thank you for your kind help.
"Went to the Hempstead Vodafone store, and was extremely happy with the service from Dylan. He found the right deal for me and helped me save money! He also set my phone up for me, a real credit to the company."
"Prajeet served me in the Fleet store today. He was very courteous, friendly, patient and allowed an amazing amount of time to get my phone set up. There was no question or query he was not prepared to answer.b"
"Absolute disgusting!!! VODAPHONE GIFTCLOUD ARE RUNNING A SCAM TO ENROL CUSTOMER IN PROMISE OF A CASHBACK/VOUCHER BUT THEY NEVER SEND IT AND YOU DONT GET ANYWHERE.

"Fantastic customer service, always helpful whenever I need something. Really polite staff. Always smiling and always answer any query's. Thank you for the great work, keep it up, amazing asset to Vodafone 😊"
I was on Holiday in Banbury when I noticed I had trouble with my phone. The staff in the Castlequay Vodafone shop were really helpful and sorted out the virus. Recommended!
Thank you Moin for sorting out my sim only plans. I was paying over the odds and went in store for a sim swap. Moin advised i was out of contract and could renew for a much better price. Great savings!!!
Very helpful and excellent member of staff. He explained everything and all the deals on offer to help me make an informed decision. I’m very pleased with the service and would recommend Vodaphone to anyone who needs a good phone deal.
"The Lower Marsh Store was brilliant, excellent. Joshua, Karina and Bo were perfect, helped me navigate through the tricky stuff and pick a good deal! Made the wife happy with her new purchase!!"
"Great service from Dhiren at the store. Helped me arrange 3 phone contracts and internet for my house with ease, made the process so simple. Definitely will be a regular customer going forward."
Popped into the shop to see what improvements Vodafone could offer me.I sat with Taj who went through everything for me. A genuinely nice chap and very helpful.
Harvey at TW branch was extremely helpful in every respect with an excellent customer manner. Nothing was too much trouble for him. Great service at this store.
"Customer service from Freddie was brilliant, knew what he was doing and helped massively on my new sim only plan. He was quick and efficient with what he does and Impressed me and my wife."
"Worst Internet provider I've ever been with! Had nothing but problems from day 1! Customer service is shockingly bad and have had to raise 2 complaints in the space of a week with them!1- Cant make an account on their website as it always has an error when I try to, it just says we are fixing the problem and it's never fixed.2- Not getting the speeds we are guaranteed in our contract.3- Their hardware (router and extender) absolutely do not work properly and had nothing but problems with them.4- Their app doesn't work at all, never connects properly to the router and just keeps going around in circles on the connectivity part.Honestly, I would avoid at all costs. And to top it off I'm paying their highest prices package! Absolute daylight robbery! I'll be looking to switch in the next couple of days to ensure I switch in the cooling off period so they can't charge me."
"Matt has been fantastic today, his customer interface was phenomenal! Really feel valued as a customer at Vodafone and can’t wait to upgrade soon - definitely will look for Matt again!"
"Home broadband installed, however Vodafone failed to get the service working within their claimed 24hrs.Still waiting for a working connection after 2days"
Taj was absolutely amazing i had a very complicated situation when trying to set up a contract. I could not thank him enough for the help he gave me today.
"AVOID THIS COMPANY IF YOU VALUE YOUR TIME!!!Signed up to get a broadband service from them. Took 1 bloody month to have an engineer to deliver the broadband to me. I was hoping that was it, but no, after only 2-3 months of operation I received a message from them saying that I have cancelled their service. I phoned them on the same day to say that I was NOT cancelling the service. After about a week, I received another email saying that I was cancelling their service. I phoned AGAIN ON THE DAY to say that I was NOT cancelling the service. Finally, today my Wi-Fi got switched off. Phoned them up, they said that they cancelled it. I had to sign up for a new service and now have to wait until middle of May (the earliest!!!) to get another broadband installed!!!Overall, I have no Wi-Fi for 3 weeks for no reason!!!I would give it 0 starts out of 5 if I could. AVOID THIS COMPANY IF YOU VALUE YOUR TIME!!!"
"Jay has been extremely helpful and professional with a great sense of humour. Good to see that exceptional customer service still exist in this day and age. Well done Jay thanks again. Regards,Istvan Imre"
The staff in the store where very professional and polite. They answered all my queries with easy to understand answers. I definitely would recommend and be back in the future.
Looked to upgrade my iPhone. The team and the manager were very welcoming and showed me the options available. I settled on a price I am very happy with. 100% would recommend.
"Absolutely hopeless! Phoned in February asking them to cancel the phone package on my broadband deal as I no longer use it. The call handler was only interested in trying to sell me a new phone package. Needless to say  it wasn’t cancelled! Been hit with my bill today and they have increased it by over £6 a month and the explanation I got was basically that I’m out of contract so they can charge what they like! Finally managed to cancel the phone package and got put through to another call handler to look at a new broadband contract. He kept me on hold for a ridiculous amount of time to then come back and tell me that he couldn’t do it as his system had gone down and that I would get a call back in 48 hours! All in all I was on the phone to them for well over an hour (probably on hold for about 45 minutes of that) to get absolutely nowhere. There’s plenty of other companies out there,so after 20 years it’s bye bye Vodafone!"
"I had a great experience in the store, the workers well very friendly and knowledgeable. They were able to help me with everything that I needed."
"William and the whole team are fantastic, they were great help. Will definitely go back into this store if I need anything else phone related."
Harry was really helpful and helped me continue with contract at a better price and the best that helped my financial situation- really couldn’t recommend him more !
we were at Vodafone in Strand and we met a very nice young man Kai.He its extremely professional and competent and very polite. Thank you Kai for being amazing.
Great service! Was seen straight away and Aadil gave me an amazing upgrade. Got a better phone for less than what I pay now and got a better data package too
"I wrote on here about vodafone making a mistake on my old bill before I left them to go to Talkmobile and then sending my details to a debt collection company which has resulted in me having to go onto medication through anxiety. Here is their response:Hi Jacqueline,I can absolutely appreciate how frustrating and concerning this situation must be. We certainly don't want you more anxious and unable to sleep!So we can get this all checked out and resolved, please come and get in touch with my team via Facebook atThanks,Vodafone Social Media TeamLET ME CONFIRM, THEY ARE STILL HOUNDING ME AND WHEN I TRY TO CALL THEIR TEAM THEY KEEP TELLING ME ITS MY FAULT.This is today's message: Failure to pay this debt or contact us to agree a payment plan may leave us no alternative but to return the account to our clients for further recovery action.     today another debt collection letter and more threats on me and my credit rating, for the first time in my life and nothing to do with me"
"Well come april 2023 vodafone increased thier prices for me it was  14.4% (that's the 10.5% CPI rate, plus 3.9%)which is equal to £13.75 per month for me,so I complained asked for a lower rate and all I got was Unfortunately, we're unable to help you with the price increase and so when I pointed out to them that asda mobile who uses the vodafone network engine, as it is exactly the same as vodafone but much much cheaper at £7.00 per month a bit better than £16.88,ID MOBILE is offering the exact same deal as vodafone but for £10.00 per/month using the three networks which vodafone is in talks with a £15 billion merger likely to happen a bit better than £20.59,TALKMOBILE same deal for £9.95 rather than£20.59 which incidentally uses vodafone network. for supply. VODAFONE IS TO EXPENSIVE WHEN OTHERS ON EXACTLY THE SAME DATE, TEXTS AND TALK TIME,SAME DEALS ARE MUCH CHEAPER.end of my contract, end of vodafone, after many years.hopeless,even deleted my posts on their facebook rather than help with a sensible reply."
"Absolutely helped my wife and I find a great deal, was technically professional and super expert. On top of that really friendly."
Fantastic experience from Ryan and his team. Warm welcome and made to feel so important.  Would recommend to anyone.  Well done Vodafone Castleford
The Blackpool team work so hard to provide great service and treat you so much better than other seaside resorts I've been too.
Absolutely wonderful service from Naz today. Very patient and supportive. Answered all my questions so that I could understand.
Michael was absolutely professional and provided an amazing service.I WILL be back to transfer my business phones to Vodafone
"Visited my local store on Sunday and was helped by Heshma. Had a technical issue with my handset, which was quickly resolved and I was on my way."
Had a great experience with Vanessa. She helped me save more money that I thought I could when upgrading. Thank you again!
"Rob was fantastic! Friendly, helpful; answered my many questions very clearly and got my broadband sorted. Totally hassle-free experience."
"Went to the store for sim card. Ché was very helpful, showed me all the options and then we decided based on my needs."
I have been going to Finbar for years and he has always took care of me over the years. Fantastic service as always and the reason I'm still with Vodafone.
Great deals. Found the right package for me. Checked exactly what I needed from a simonly deal and offered a plan that suited my needs.
"Excellent customer service. Adam was very friendly, patient and helpful in helping us find what we were looking for."
Rob was great - helped me with my broadband order after confusion about what i was to pay & delivery etc great asset

Mark was a total legend….and could not have been more helpful!…..customer service at its 100% very best!….Thank you….and Yin too!!
"Took over an hour to complete an upgrade that I could have done in minutes online. Natalie didn't seem to know what she was doing & had to keep asking Matthew what to do. I went to the store expecting them to have the phones in stock but they didn't have any stock so would have to order it for me. I told them that I wouldn't be at home to accept the delivery & the only day I could get to the store to collect was today, I couldn't decide what to do until I was told by both that it's next day delivery so would be there on Monday. I've been in store twice today (Tuesday) & they still haven't got my phone. That's all very well Vodafone, but as I said in the shop & in my review, the only day that I could get to collect my order was yesterday (Tuesday) it doesn't make a difference if you send a text when it's ready & that you'll keep it for 7 days if I can't get in to collect it. I was told it would be in on the Monday which would enable me to collect it on the Tuesday like I've said several times it's the only day I could have collected it. I only ordered it because I was told it would be there for me to collect on the Tuesday."
"I've been with Vodafone for broadband for several years and have been through the contract renewal process before only to get a modest price increase within months. I renewed again over the phone in Feb 23 for a 2 year deal and allowed myself to be upsold a mobile bundle at the same time, porting over 2 phones from giffgaff. What a mistake! 14.4% increase after only 1 month, and a whole load of opaque nonsense about a £1 per month ""secure net"" add-on that I cancelled before the free trial ended, but due to ""billing cycles"" still got charged anyway. Of course the 14.4% April increase was in the T+Cs, but no wonder the sales teams are so keen to push ""great deals"" in February!  I fully regret leaving Giffgaff, thinking I was simplifying things and saving money by having broadband and mobile under one account, and instead have spent hours in circular online chats and ended up paying more. Lesson learnt - can't trust the ""great deals"" that Vodafone push and will head back to the simplicity and clarity of Giffgaff as soon as this contract ends."
"Jevon was such a good help with me today, took the time to explain everything he was doing to help us out,"
Zara Uxbridge very good took time to explain things. Good personal touch. Will go back if I need anything.
Patrick was the Best. He knows many language so he help me so much.Now my life easier.And Vodafone nice People. Thankyou
Jay is doing an amazing job and would definitely recommend the shop to anyone who’s looking for excellent costumer service. Thank you.

"If it weren't for Kimberley, the manager at the Camberley store I, my daughter and my partner would have left Vodafone long ago. We prefer Vodafone for its coverage and ease of use especially when travelling to Thailand, but their central administration and continuous failures and broken promises were just too much.One day about 3-4 years ago, out of sheer frustration we walked into the Camberley store and met Kimberley and suddenly life with Vodafone became so simple. She's like a friend now and we rely on her for all our comms including broadband, and we would be lost without her.PS: I posted my review because I understood it was specifically for the Camberley store. However, following it being published online, it does appear to be another Vodafone scam where they are looking to increase their trustpilot rating by deflecting comments about their central services and focusing on Customer Service and staff at store level. To be clear, Vodafone are the worst network and company I have ever encountered, they very rarely if ever follow through on a promise or commitment or any telephone discussion with their central customer services. If I were to rate Vodafone and not the individual store, it would be -5.I feel disappointed and a little bit conned that Vodafone have used my review of the Camberley store and the manager there in an attempt to boost their overall performance ratings on trustpilot and I hope trustpilot pick up on this."

"Very bad experience with Vodafone,  when it comes down to it. All was absolutely fine for around two years, untill covid hit the uk.I found myself in a situation were my wages wernt stretching as far as i needed them too. Being self employed, like many people, put great pressure on household bills.I contacted Vodafone, to see if there was anything they could do to help ease the pressure, for a month or two. I even suggested breaking down the one month line renal i owed into smaller payments. What a waste of time that was, i was passed from pillow to post, being told no we cant help. Then yes we can by someone else, then getting a phone call back to say that person was wrong and we now cannot help.For the sake of one months bill, for Vodafone not to help there customers. when the uk was going though an absolute nightmare.I had only missed one payment in my whole contract makes no sense. Then to top it off they turned off my lines, sent me a bill for £4000 and told me i needed to pay this.It then took the original manager from a complaint i made 6 month earlier to contact me and say we can do a paymnet plan and reconnect your lines, erm hello i have a new phone provider, dont think so. I offered to send the two phones back from there contract, and was told its to late now. Either reconnect or pay the bill (£4000)It was to late because they cannot communicate or keep you informed. And leave things 6 month to try and sort.And all i got was these things happen.So conclusion Is Customer service is terrible They dont communicate They give you false information And if you end up in a tuff situation they will fob you off, like you dont matter.Now i am not saying every adviser is like this, because that wouldn't be fair. But the structure of the company, is somewhat to be desired.Daye of experience is wrong it was 2020/2021"

"I wish it was possible to give ratings below 1star. I have been with Vodafone for years. I have been let down by this company so many times it becomes hard to track. They registered me as a BUSINESS (I am NOT!) when I first went to the shop to buy a SIM and I only randomly found out a year later, when I was renewing the contract. I could have incurred into financial troubles for this and it took the company months to finally amend that. Last year I got a fibre contract with them. Signed, got the router, got the appointment with the engineer who couldn't carry out the connection for health & safety reasons (scaffolding was in the way, although it would have surely been safer than the flimsy ladder he was carrying)... Had to wait months before I could call to book another engineer's appointment. Got a call back saying they were not covering my area anymore (out of the blue), despite their website stating otherwise. Ended up with a 5G contract and a mobile router. Speed should have been reliable, up to 100mb/s. Instead, it's been a constant up and down between 20, 8, 10, 30, 2 mb/s in the span of a few seconds. Connection jumps between 4G and 5G constantly and, on top of that, Secure Net was added to my plan, without being outlined (nor included) in the contract. I pointed out this breach of contract, after randomly logging into My Vodafone App and noticing I had Secure Net on, despite never asking for it. So, after many years as a customer, I had enough and demanded to have the contract cancelled, due to a clear lack of transparency, hidden, unsolicited costs and an appalling Customer Service experience. After being repeatedly lied to, by being told Secure Net was in my contract and I was given multiple notices of it and a back and forth of days, they admitted the extra was not cited in the contract but denied any wrongdoing or breach of contract and offered a refund of a whopping 10£, without even an apology for accusing me of being inattentive and, implicitly, of being a liar... I obviously refused, as it's about trust, customer care and HONESTY (all things they don't even know the definition of) and I do not want to be serviced by them anymore, after the treatment I received. They wouldn't budge and demanded I pay a fee to exit the contract THEY breached. So I am now in the process of escalating this with CISAS. If after reading my review you are still considering choosing Vodafone as your provider, keep reading the countless reviews that resonate with mine and stray away like your life depended on it! IT IS NOT WORTH THE HASSLE!!! The plans are expensive, the line temperamental at best and utterly unreliable as a standard and their respect for customers inexistent. Look for better, cheaper, more honest companies to rely on and have a more enjoyable experience overall!"
"I have nothing but bad things to say about Vodafone. I’ve been a loyal customer for a few years now and have had nothing but painful experiences.. I’m now at Peak frustration because I cannot get a mortgage purely based on the fact that Vodafone had late payments marked on my account. However, Vodafone and their debt, collection, agency zinc group appear totally incompetent and unable to investigate the reason behind the late payments.. if they were to investigate properly and look at my file and through all of the phone calls, I have made them in the last six months. Then they would see that me as the customer has called six or more times to instruct the payments over the phone, using my bankcard and reset up my direct debit with Barclays. . Every time I call they tell me everything is sorted on their side, but a month later I receive another notification saying the funds have not been taken on my account is still in debt.. I have also raised many complaints to the customer service staff which have not been logged or even investigated. All they would need to do would be to look for listen to the phone calls over the last six months to see this or hear this.. as a result, I’m trying to get a mortgage with HSBC, but they have wrongfully sent my account to collections despite my best efforts to make the payments with them and I’m unable to get a mortgage because of these markers on my credit report. Their customer service is so bad, I can’t tell you and would recommend to anybody stay away from Vodafone and move to a company like EE. I only have a device plan which is £16 a month and this is preventing me from getting a mortgage which will cost me tens of thousands of pounds. After five hours on the phone yesterday, I got nowhere, apart from being told that my account was again in debit with no communication that was previously and how to set my direct debit up again.. the agents you  speak to spend ages looking through your file, but appear completely incompetent, and I unable to digest the information that’s been put down by the agents spoken to before. Please do not use Vodafone for any of your devices or broadband, because it is just not worth it.. I’ve had 12 months of pure pain and waste of time. Now I need to get them to urgently. Remove the credit markers on my account so they don’t show on my credit score or report but I can’t but anything that they will not be able to do that because they aren’t capable of looking at the detail and getting an understanding of why the payments were late. , which it is very clear in my case was not my fault as the customer, and therefore I should not be punished for it. I have no issues with my credit and earn enough money many times over to fund my Vodafone account so this is totally ridiculous.. all I have is a device plan with Vodafone and my old number has now been moved to EE which is (07469) 716149."
A very good and interactive experience from ionut.
"Clear, courteous and comprehensive service!!"

Fernando is amazing and quite knowledgeable.  Great customer service.
The staff were great! Popped in on the weekend and Dylan looked after me with a fantastic deal and couldn’t be happier! All round great service and great team. From start to finish was amazing.
"WARNING - Be aware of Terms and conditions in new contracts for broadbandWe have been with Vodafone broadband for over 5 years and the contracts have changed, I'm on a fixed contract for 2 years and thought that meant that the price would be fixed! Prices now go up every April even if your in a contact, mine has increased by nearly £5 a month, no doubt it will go up again by the same next April.I will be leaving Vodafone ASAP and never retuning"
Aadil was really helpfull and each time I need any sort of help his always there to help me. Amazing guy. Highly recommended.
"Served by Guppi, who gave an excellent friendly service. Explained everything so I could understand"

Brilliant service from the staff after issues with my phone.  Professional & helpful. Can’t recommend highly enough.
"We stopped by the Vodaphone BelfastDonegallPlace upon arriving in Belfast and Dylan was exceptionally helpful in showing us the options for a SIM card and 1 month's service during our visit, and setting it all up on our phone. Dylan's kind manner made us feel welcome and his professionalism assured us that we were in good hands. The plan we chose was exceptional in price and services included."
Put price up a month after I signed a contract. Avoid at all costs. Scam artists
"I was really shocked to find my out of contract tariff was huge but Mieszko went through all the options for upgrading to find the best for each family member, patiently answering my many questions. Everyone happy with their new plan."
Alan from the vodafone store on princess st. He was absolutely amazing with helping us. 5 stars!!!
This experience was very nice and and Renee was very nice and helpful
Very friendly service. The staff know what they are doing exactly. Super helpful. Not busy on sunday evenings.
Thank you Colin for great service. You were so helpful and took time to explain all the options available to us.
Smashed my phone and they got me up and running in hours- copy data - sorted phone - just great service - they know there stuff
"Superb service. Staff are efficient,polite and helpful."
"Signed up for broadband in March but the service didn’t work at all, tried calling regularly, eventually after 3 days got through. The Indian based adviser asked me to do things like press reset etc still no connection. He explained it can take 14 days to ‘settle down’. I said I need it to work immediately. Very long story short I cancelled. Had to pay to return the equipment. They have sent emails and a letter about my bill! Took 2.5 hours on the phone today to to get them to cancel the charges for a service they did not provide. They refused to refund the postage I’ve paid to return the equipment. They had sent an addressed label but it was not pre-paid. They won’t cancel without the equipment being returned. My opinion is to avoid this company at all costs. I’ve returned to BT who are excellent for broadband, just more expensive. No point paying if there’s no service!"
Georgi was extremly helpful. She helped me choose the perfect package for my needs
"We were served by Charlie who was a gem to deal with. Pleasant and conscientious, she checked anything she wasn’t sure about with Paul the manager. The whole experience was stress free and we left happy customers."
Pete was very helpful and understanding of circumstances- would recommend!
"I am disgusted at the service provided for a new (returning) customer by Vodafone.I ordered broadband from Vodafone and before the day of connection was sent a text AND an email saying when the connection would happen and that the engineer did not need to visit so I did not have to be at home. So we carried on with our arrangements to be away that day.On connection day the engineer phoned saying he did need to visit. I told him the emails had said we didn't need to be present and I was promised phone calls to sort things out, which I never received.The following day, I called Vodafone and after nearly 2 hours on the phone an appointment was finally made for the engineer to come the next day.The next day the engineer did not turn up! On phoning Vodafone and spending a further 30 minutes on the phone, I was told that a reason couldn't be given and it would be 48 hours before we could even book a new appointment.At this point I had already been without broadband for 2 days and I was so disgusted with the service that I cancelled the contract.Unbelievable! If, like me your work is dependent on your broadband, my advice would be don't use Vodafone."
"The person that we spoke to us was really nice and patient and very inviting, made the process so much better"
Danny was very knowledgeable and helpful. Made experience of upgrading phone effortless
"3 months and a half to get the fiber connected...got Openreach to dig the cable in front of my place, and have to wait another month to get some engineer to do some cable work at the nearest lines hub. Ive been working remotely with the 4G with less than a mb/s most of the time (also on vodafone network - and I'm using a proper 4g router with a large coaxial antenna ), it goes without saying my mental health went quite down.Unless you are planning to get your internet in ages, dont take the fiber offer, the waiting list is insane. I would go faster working with a carrier pigeon"
Very good experience for me today
"Fantastic customer service,  Zara and Merhban very friendly"
"Zubair was very helpful and patient taking me through my best options and extremely professional, I left Vodaphone shop feeling satisfied that I had made the right decision, Thank you for your professionalism Zubair"
"Very helpful, extremely friendly, top quality customer service."
Very helpful and took time to explain everything regarding the new contacts etc. Very good customer service.
"Jacob was really helpful, broke down my options in an understandable way and was very easy to talk to"
Had Vodaphone for a few months now with a 900mbps package. Download is better than what I’m paying for and I’m regularly hitting 950+Mbps download. Just had a customer service experience which was great and all concerns I had got resolved immediately. Direct Debit date was changed and I was given login details to use my own router. One con which I would give is the signal strength of the standard router which would be resolved by ordering Vodaphone pro package but this is an extra £15 per month. I’m paying £35 a month so despite the one con I have to give this 5* as the price is far better than competitors.
"I came last Monday and I was very happy with the service. My English is not too good but thanks to Anna's help, I understood everything. She explained to me how everything works and I am very happy with the help I got."
"Excellent service from Nurul, very helpful and clear with options"
"I went in to the Vodafone store in Carmarthen, was seated in a waiting area for 5min before I  asked Dave to upgrade my SIM only contact without the hard sell, he delivered exactly what I asked for.Can't fault the service, fantastic.5 ⭐"
A huge thank you to Sohaib who helped change my accounts and sort out my nightmare of not remembering information linked to Spotify etc. couldn’t have been more patient and helpful. Thank you!!
PETER Helped me with a problem and sorted me out in 5 minutes.  Great service.
Ferit in Romford branch gave me excellent service 5star 👍👍 defo recommend him and the store
"At the end of our contract, Vodafone kept us for 90 mins on a live chat, whilst we were trying to cancel our subscription. Of course we failed security (no idea why) and we have to continue paying monthly fees.  I passed security twice. Why do they make it so difficult to cancel ?"
Fantastic service by in store staff cutting monthly bill and getting upgraded phones as well as broadband at a cheaper price. Katie and Stevie know what customer service is all about!
Zara was very helpful and friendly and I was very happy with her professional help thank you 👍
We brought an IPhone watch for my partner who is blind. It has a one number sim. for the last 12 months that we have had it there is no one week that it hasn't worked. I have called many many times to get help. The same experience everytime pushy arrogant and rude staff talking to us like we are stupid We have checked on community pages. Reset it with Vodafone etc and still no joy. I called today to cancel it and ask for a refund. We were offered another reset before they would consider a refund. We decided to cancel anyway. The stress levels this causes for us both when all my partner wants to do is go out and know he is trackable and can be called if needed through the watch instead of carrying his phone. Don't bother with  Vodafone one number its a waste of time and money. Talked to a lovely lady in cancellations who helped alot and made that experience better. She even had issues cancelling it and tracing the sim. An absolute nightmare. This service is not fit for purpose. Do you train your staff to be ignorant?  We will be moving the last of our numbers awayAnother hour of our day wasted arguing and being talked down to by staff.
The customer service was absolutely exceptional. They were so helpful in my enquiries and decision making.
10 out of 10 Allisia in the Southampton store brilliant very clear.!!
"Excellent service from a super friendly team. Sales assistant had good knowledge of all services and products, and was very patient and helpful."
Fabulous customer service! What an asset to the team! Thank you Jacob!
"AndreeaShe was absolutely amazing! Really nice and really helpful, she was able to do everything what i asked for.i am absolutely happy with everything."
We have been in for various upgrades and additions to our account. We have spoken to Natalie each time and she has been fantastic! So helpful and always bubbly making the process an enjoyable experience even when the system is on a go slow. Thank you for all the help your awesome!
"It's like a contract with the Mafia!I've been with Vodafone for years, probably over 23 years. When things go well they're fine and the staff at the shops are great. That's where any positive aspects end.This phone is a back up phone as I have a company mobile that allows personal use and so it mostly sits in a drawer gathering dust.8 years ago I moved to a house where Vodafone's signal was abysmal. Daughter on Three was fine and partner on O2 fine. When I contacted Vodafone they denied a problem and tried to sell me the Sure Signal package. I spent over an hour on the phone with them getting them to zoom into the map closer to the point where they could actually see the house sits in a signal blackspot! I can get signal in the garden but in the house I have to move to one corner in an upstairs room to get 1-2 bars. Finally they relented and gave me the sure signal box free but only after I threatened to move networks. One point worth mentioning about sure signal or any connection over WiFi/Internet, the App refuses to let you into your account unless you're on mobile data so it's a pretty pointless app for me. With sure signal I was able to get texts and calls etc again so I left it at that. The phone returned to the drawer with only occasional use. Roll forward to today - Sure Signal is no longer active as they withdrew the service as most phones are WiFi calling enabled - I don't know that mine is.Today I see the bill has gone up 13% - I can get a SIM only deal with unlimited data/calls/text for £10/month less so I figure it's time to switch.Text PAC to 65075 and get a message back saying they don't understand my message and if I want to get a PAC code I need to text my PAC and my PIN - sounds a bit dodgy so I go to Vodafone/leaving and follow the instructions which tells me to go to my account. Guess what - they're having technical difficulties so I can't log in. I'm hard of hearing so calling someone isn't an option.So it looks like I need to go into a store to sort this out. Nothing is ever simple or straightforward with this company"
"Vodafone has a whole clearly doesn't want me as a customer any moreProbably been with them for 10 years and till recently never really had any problems.But wouldn't let me upgrade early,so waited until the end of my contract still won't let me upgrade ( but can put prices up nearly 15 percent on my bill)I am in full time employment, on the electoral roll, lived at the same address for over 11 years, open bank accounts with no arrears, just ordered a new £40,000 car on finance, not in any bother with police or legal systems, don't drink smoke or do any form of drugsIn my eyes a polite person who needs a reliable phone as I travel well over 25,000 miles a year driving and for some reason not eligible or the type of individual that Vodafone is looking for business from !!Well that's absolutely fine with me I am sure that other phone providers will be willing to take some of my hard earned money from meKind regardsJames"
"Terrible service, rude arrogant customer support that jsut repeat themselves over and over instead of trying to solve a problem. Sent me the wrong phone, then when I called to resolve the issue , was put on hold for 10 mins only to be told as we are small business instead of a larger one I need to wait till tommorw, further delaying me in reviving a replacement phone"
Nick was very amazing and very helpful with upgrading my phone.
"Gave 1 months notice on phone. Told nothing due as pay upfront. Closed account. They then decide to chase us for money, then bead credit us! Worst company ever! Major issues with them! Avoid at all costs!Margaret has contacted me to try and sort out. Let’s see what happens"
My assistant went above and beyond and was very informative.
"Excellent customer service from Lorna. Feel like I got value for money and a fantastic deal, much better than competitors (EE, o2 etc)."
"Upgraded to new iphone today, Lorna was fantastic she explained everything comprehensively and broke down the plan/tariff etc in detail. Store was very busy but still made me feel like I was the only one there. Seamless experience from beginning to end, highly recommend! :)"
"Great store, most staff are super friendly and quite knowledgeable. Dylan in particular helped me solving an issue I had with my SIM card."
Very pleasant and patient explaining all the options.
"I visited the store looking to upgrade my current device, I was warmly greeted by Michael. He was really personable and just like the title says he knew his stuff. He asked questions about about my interests and lifestyle and matched me with a device (s23)."
"I don’t know where to begin with this company. But if you have any kind of problem, rest assured it either won’t be solved or it will be an uphill battle. The left hand never knows what the right hand is doing. I’m actually amazed it manages an average score on here.Can’t wait until my contact is up, so I can change to another provider. This time I’ll do my homework and find one with good customer service.I’m actually exhausted from trying to solve what should be a very simple issue."
"We met a staff member called Harry today who couldn’t have been better, we didn’t even know what we wanted to do with our sim only contracts but after a questions he took charge and told us an option he had for us that was perfect and sounded very reasonable. A few moments after it was all done and we walked away happy. Thanks Harry we will be back to see him to sort out another sim contact when the time comes."
Waste time contract  still not end I found  out instead  charge  £22 I found out they charge  me  over£46! Sim ony deal worse company!
The guys were really patient with me whilst I was having a drama about my phone dying. They explained things in simple terms and made the mobile phone jargon understandable. Thank you so much for your time (over 2 hours!).
"I never seen lıke thıs servıce ın UK before they are amazıng so kınd and support to us. After thıs servıce ı wıll talk to all my frıends to swıtch vodafone.Thank you Ahmer, and hıs staff Jabar and Albert"
"Jack was very professional, knowledgeable and met our needs.  He was ablely supported by other staff to deal with acouple of technical questions I had. We had an excellent experience"
Straight forward and easy to deal with Shakunt. Understood our needs and met our requirement and saved us money on existing contracts too as well as sort out a completely new contract. Great service
"Henry was very patient,polite and extremely helpful"
The staff was very helpful in the St Albans store
Amazing service today in the Vodafone Craigavon store was served by Glen got me a new phone and swapped my data over
Very helpful 👌 - Prajeet
"Can I say what a high standard of customer service was shown by Josh when we went in to report a lost phone. He communicated clearly and expertly, we didn't feel talked down to by a potential 'techie'and he told us what to do, the differences between lost and stolen and supplied a replacement sim card on the spot. He went the extra mile and was a much better option than the 'bot' on the internet or the overseas techie on a long distance line. Thank you very much.And he helped us to get new SIM working when mobile was found the day after. Excellent stuff."
"Kayleigh was extremely helpful. She explained the different options available to us. No pressure selling. Friendly, informal but informative chat which led to our final decisions."
"Had reason to visit my local Vodafone store today. With the intention of upgrading my phone. My point of contact was with the lovely lady Joleen. She took my details and she viewed my account, and then she reminded me that I have been paying beyond my contract date, she was very open about this and I admire her openness to this situation, my buying a new phone has now become secondary and all credit to her she held my hand in all the details. We made contact with the billing department of Vodafone in an attempt to put things right, i still have beef to resolve with the billing department at Vodafone, but Joleen of Ashford Kent your a star."
"We were served by Jack, who was very helpful and attentive, polite and professional."
"The staff in this shop are brilliant, in spite of the company trying to fail me, because of the staff I persevered with Vodafone"
Cedric was very helpful and helped me sort out my discount for my phone upgrade
I have been into a few Vodafone branches and Farnham is the only branch that has that personal touch.  Whether it's fixing my phone settings or getting me the right price and package... They are people first and sales second ..
"Very professional and polite,she helped me in all the problems I have,I m very happy with the experience I had here today."
"Kimberley was amazingly helpful, and sorted us out with great phones"

Luke was very helpful Brilliant stuff

She explained the different phone options ref price, data allowance, gigabytes etc so that we could make an informed choice based on our requirements and budget, she gave advice about our sons planned trip to Japan regarding phone usege.

They was helped me  fast with my request. Thank you for this
I paid a visit to St Andrews Vodafone as I was due an upgrade and wanted some advice. I've been a customer with Vodafone for almost 20 years and have had the pleasure of dealing with Danny many times. I sat down with David for a great chat and got his opinions and advice about my options. David and Danny both took great interest in my needs as a customer and were more than happy to answer any questions I had. Danny even took the time out of his day to entertain my 3 year old son which was a great help while I needed to concentrate. Overall a great experience with a great bunch of guys. Will definitely visit this store again.
Costumer service was excellent very helpful and informative. Highly recommend
Was serviced by Glen that helped me pick my new phone as my last one was smashed he explained everything well and helped me get my new phone set up
Did an upgrade with Alle. Great experience and very professional adviser.
"Jacob was super professional, clear and concise in his explanation of my new contract. Happy customer. Thank you"

Knowing exactly what I want and not trying miss sell me anything else. Nichola always offers a great service.
"Disgusting increase and awful CS.The customer service at Vodafone is non existing. I've been trying to cancel my mobile contract which is out of contract. Its virtually impossible to do.On top of which, the recent increase of nearly 15% was the last straw. I urge anyone out of contract to cancel and go elsewhere."
"I used to be a Vodafone mobile customer and the phone service was so bad almost everywhere I went. I was on their highest tier with constant low speeds, and then they had the audacity to increase my price mid contract for ""investment into services and infrastructure"" yeah right, more like investment into shareholders pockets. The phone service isn't great at all and I saw ZERO improvements. I ended up going to EE after trialling their network on pay as you go for a week. Amazing speeds pretty much everywhere I went! I get up to 700Mbps in my area and usually my speeds are over 100Mbps anywhere I go. In contrast I was lucky to get 0.5 - 7Mbps on Vodafone and often, although I had a full signal, there would be weird things happening like pictures not sending in apps, extremely long buffering times for music or video etc. Not good enough for £36 a month!Also, I'm still, unfortunately, in contract for Vodafone's landline broadband, which they just increased in price mid-contract again! I don't see the justification for this because they don't even own the infrastructure! Where's the ""service investment"" going? These mid-contract price increases are so blatantly just an excuse for profiteering and not investment!As soon as my contract is up I'm going with grain full fibre broadband, as they own the infrastructure and DON'T increase prices mid-contract to scam the customer out of more money!"
"I ordered a new contract phone for my sister and went through Quidco as usual. Today 21st April i get an email saying Hi,We are writing to you about your cashback claim.On this occasion, the retailer has declined your cashback claim advising us that the order number you have provided on the claim form doesn't match an order purchased using Quidco. This could mean that the order details submitted on the claim form weren't correct or that Quidco has not been recognised as the referrer for this purchase, and so the commission has not been paid to Quidco, which means we can't pass it on to you as cashback.This could happen if you used a search engine, comparison site or voucher code site or if you had multiple browser tabs open when purchasing.We appreciate this is very frustrating, but we value you as a Quidco member and would like to give you something to make up for it. We have provided a unique Bonus just for you!So Vodafone are exactly like Virgin Mobile as they did the same a couple of years back, any excuse to not part with the money.I clicked through from Quidco and ordered a new phone and contract, what more did i need to do?...... NOTHING as it should have tracked but it didn't, so i had to make a claim. The date showed on the time i clicked on quidco through to vodafone and i have screenshots as proof. So vodafone are LIARS"
I called in to the Gosport branch for assistance with transferring a couple of phone numbers over. Alex was very helpful and sorted it all out for me. I’ll definitely pop in again if I have any issues instead of calling Vodafone or using their live chat.
"Hi,Im extremely happy with Mr. Richard the way he attended and suggested this is called customer 100% satisfaction"
"Absolutely appalling customer service. I was sent a text on March 27th saying that I had broken the acceptable usage policy using my data abroad for too long and that I had 14 days until the started charging me. They proceeded to charge me on my March bill for the entire month and refused to remove the charges despite the company specifically telling me I had 14 days before they started charging and that is according to their policy I should get 14 days notice. I accept that they will start charging from 14 days from March 27th, that is not the issue. The issue is telling me you're not going to charge me before a certain date and then proceeding to charge me. Took 1 hr on the chat to even get a reason why and the customer service person was completely unhelpful and rude."
"James was great. Nothing was too much hassle, explained everything clearly in a way we could understand with no jargon. James is a great asset to the store."
"Went in for my upgrade and spoke to Matt, made everything super simple and left feeling like I got a really good deal for my money ! Couldn't recommend enough"
Absolutely appalling service from Vodafone. First order for Broadband fibre cancelled due to salesperson not doing their job correctly. Eventually got a date to install for a month after first date that was cancelled without telling me. Openreach were great. Then Vodafone strike again by not providing phone adaptor and switching on the phone side at their end. Still waiting after 3 days without landline only to be told could take 24 to 48 hours. Unbelievably bad customer care.Update - despite another adaptor being sent out it still not showing as being collected let alone in transit. Been a week without a landline now. Avoid using Vodafone if you want to keep your landline!
"1. Terrible, overpromised speeds - internet regularly drops out - they will put you on the phone for hours while issues are ""diagnosed"" but ultimately nothing will be done;2. They put up your contract under CPI and include a non-standard operational fee (except an additional charge of roughly 15% per year);3. They don't make it easy for you to raise a complaint to the Ombudsmen through shady practices."
Great service from Bam Very professional and articulate
Beauty from kıngs road spent over 2hrs helpıng wıth our upgrades. Good servıce
Awful customer service. They don't care about their customers at all. No customer loyalty
Very good customer service had a great experience in Chichester Vodafone thank you Kofi.
"Very happy with service received today, the guys went through the best deal that suited me. Very pleased. 5*****"
"Popped into vodaphone Kidderminster shop to purchase a sim only contract, the 2 guys Callum and Benji were extremely helpful and patient as had problems finding my address, thank you so much guys"
Excellent service! Chris is very helpful.
"I believe that Vodafone are attempting to force me into terminating my home broadband contract by underhand means and they are doing this because they are withdrawing new services from rural areas due to expense of maintaining them. To begin with my  home broadband price has increased by 50%. And keeps increasing month on month.  No-one can explain such a large and unexpected increase. I did NOT sign a contract with a large promotional discount. It is true that the contract has expired, but generally this can be resolved by renewing the contract. However, when  I call to renew my contract I am told that due to a technical upgrade being required in my area, no renewals or upgrades are available, I cannot sign a new contract and Vodafone cannot improve the price. No date can be given as to when these upgrades will be completed. I am free to  move to another provider, however due to the remote nature of my location no other providers are willing to provide a broadband service other than BT, who will not provide a landline service in a rural area where there are no public call boxes and mobile reception is patchy. These leaves me unable to contact emergency services.As you will see from Vodafone’s reply below, they have no interest in resolving my issue. I did not sign a contract with a discounted monthly price which would then increase at the end of the term, the price I paid was the regular monthly broadband cost for all broadband only contracts at the time. It was a fixed price contract which was subject to regular April RPI increases but I’ve been a Vodafone home broadband customer for many years now and NEVER have I seen such an unprecedented jump when a contract expired. 10% RPI inflation + 3.9% is nowhere near 50%. This requires a more detailed explanation than “you are out of contract”. It’s extortion to force customers to leave. Vodafone clearly haven’t read my review as I’ve already reached out to the sales team multiple times only to be told nothing is possible except to leave. The attempt at responding is little short of pathetic. It’s a cosmetic attempt to be seen to be offering assistance but providing none. It’s like putting lipstick on a pig. It’s still a pig.The only suggestion Vodafone  can make is to check for other Broadband providers in my area which as indicated above there is only the BT no landline option which I feel will place me in danger. Vodafone have NO INTEREST in assisting me or investigating this matter in fact they WANT me to leave. I cannot stress enough how you should AVOID this company. They are extortionists and their “customer service” is a facade. Just look at the reply below. It speaks for itself,"
Bam was efficient and got me a great deal .
I came in in January to ask about Vodafone contracts. I saw the same advisor as I did today Vanessa. She helped me  to switch from business to my own account which I’m very happy with. Many thanks.
"Robin helped me go through choosing a plan, helping me set up my eSim , fantastic customer experience, competitive pricing very knowledgeable on products 🙂"
The customer service was excellent and the manager treated me very nicely and sorted all my queries perfectly.
Lilly was lovely and extremely helpful... a pleasure to deal with and a credit to your company
Great customer service well done to Ben and Dan
"I had the strong sense that the advisor, Thea, really was looking to find me the best deal. She reviewed my past data usage in detail and made very helpful observations and suggestions. I would trust her advice."
"Andreea was super professional, got all the details I needed. Thank you very much!"
Nice experience with Andreea
Excellent customer service well mannered and extremely helpful
Deniz was extremely helpful and very efficient. Great service.
"Amazing service, Taz literally walked me through the entire problem i was having and even assisted in my call to customer service. Truly so supportive. Amazing staff."
"Tony and Gary could not be more helpful, professional and efficient, a pleasure to deal with. They went over and above from point if sale to support and transferring of data. A massive thank you to both"
Friendly professional and very helpful and understanding of someone not tech savvy!
Richard was very kind and thoughtful explaining everything to me and I was very greatful to him.
"Such a disappointment. I had a leaflet through my door informing me new cables had been installed ready for Vodafone internet. I signed up and selected my instalment date. The instalment date has long sinced passed, and they state they need an engineer to come any install the cables? I have been given many false promises, and now to add to the insult ive been given an engineer date of the end of August!!!!Absolutely ridiculous. Why advertise that you can offer a service if you cannot. Its false advertising. I am not impressed and I will be looking at alterntive providers. I will not recommend Vodafone to anyone."
"Bam fixed my account and saved me a lot of money, couldnt ask for more"
"Amazing . I had superb support from Altin at kings Rd . I was pretty distraught having had my phone stolen . Altin was calm , empathic and completely thorough and clear in his knowledge base of options available to me to purchase a new phone . He was superb and also supported by his very kind manager . I could not be more happy with this service ! Many thanks"
Denis has been very helpful and efficient a positive experience
Very helpful 👌 ☺️
The Bridgend team helped me with my broadband package! They were such a lovely team and very knowledgable! The lady made sure that I had everything I needed to start my job working from home! My booster has been a life saver and I’m very grateful for the support offered.
thank you so much for your help you were so patient with me as I was distressed and so knowledgeable. I will be recommending you to all my friends and family. Thank you Debra Davies
"Great service from John, thank you"
"Bam was very helpful and knowledgeable and helped me with my contract, he was also very patient as I’m not very technical"
"Assisted me in buying a charger, great friendly staff"
Vicki at Newton Abbot store was brilliant and explained everything and the options we had for upgrade. A really good experience. We were given plenty of info about costs and how they are now split. She was willing to give us time to discuss and wasnt at all pushy. Great customer service.
"What made our Vodaphone experience in Bromsgrove great was Dan. He is extremely knowledgeable, professional and helpfull. He took all the time necessary to help with all of our questions. He explained everything in terms we understood and without use of jargon. Really great service and an asset to the company."
Moved from sky to vodaphone full fiber easy to order online installation day came engineers arrived did there stuff but missing router contacted them and told wrong address and person it was sent to so re send out another one I was told give it 2 days dpd will deliver still no router phoned customer services and was told would be delivered today but  I had told her I have had had no msg or text from dpd so she said she would check and then come back and told me it was sent it it will be sent out today I told her want compensated for loss of earnings as work from home need internet  the inconvenience of all this and loss of service and was told have to wait for my service to be up and running before compensation can be giving and have the cheek to text me to say my monthly bill will be due on 30th havnt had any services
Great service and a joy to talk to. Would be the main reason I would come back to the service due to his professionalism. An absolute gentleman
Ben explained well and was patient with me ( older and no tech knowledge)
"VODAFONE REFUSES TO GIVE ME MY PAC CODE. 9 hours of phone and chat lines over 7 weeks. Moved about to approx 25 different teams. Vodafone you upsold me an upgrade. I cancelled next day and you then lied saying that cancellation didn’t exist, even though I have cancellation number. Vodafone you have broken laws on 14 day cooling off period. Vodafone you have broken the law on PAC codes. Vodafone you have reduced me to tears 5 times and are causing serious mental stress to a woman of nearly 70 years!"
They are marvellous! Top marks!
Customer service like Customer seems should be! Absolutely amazing! The advisor show amazing patience and assisted with all that I asked help with never once making me feel like I was an inconvenience outstand Customer service well done Levi at Vodafone Tamworth
Fantastic service I've been going to this store for many years for an upgrade on my business phones. Always explained the best deals to suite my business needs.
Kirsty and Racky were absolutely brilliant. They couldn't do enough for us. They were very knowledgeable about the tech and the Vodafone procedures. Fantastic job.
Very friendly and Kirsty & Ricky were fab!
"Went to the i store the the customer experience was terrible, came to vodaphone and your manager was the brilliant, will come here first time always from now on."
"Ravi was really funny and made my trip to Vodafone which I usually am scared of, every entertaining. He was efficient and kind."
"Rado.helped me set my email, great service"
Aaron was great and helped me go from top up to contract and save money
The service from Michal was excellent and helpful. The staff where very welcoming!!!
"Friendly, informative. Happy outcome."
"Hi Sir/Madam,It was such a breath of fresh Air and a delightful experience, to have dealt with Mr Chad at the Fulham Vodaphone Store.He was quite knowledgeable and didn’t try to sell me however, he made me comfortable and more trusting of the Vodaphone Brand. I’m quite convinced that he is a rising Star and will become your Brand Manager, in due time. Continued success to the Company & Thank you for my New Service. Sincere regards! Robert London."
"Good advice and all my questions were answered expertly. My visit was a positive experience and Lily was helpful, polite and professional at all times. Thank you for your assistance."
"Has turned into an absolutely diabolical company, having been with Vodafone for 11 years today enough is enough. - Always poor signal - Calls always dropping out- Says I have 4G yet cannot load web pages,- You CANNOT speak to someone on the phone, live chat only (I tried pretty much every option available) No doubt the reply will be like the other copy and paste replies saying to get in touch with them on social media, well I dont have Facebook or Twitter so this review will do. Any NEW customer should AVOID this company like the plague."
I visited the store to change my tariff and Reece dealt with the situation very efficiently and was professionally prepared to help make the transition easily! He was friendly and approachable! But then I had an enormous issue in that my original number was lost and I had a new number allocated which was awful because all my medical contacts were unable to contact my husband and I! We are retired and under the hospital constantly ( my husband had a triple bypass! ) We went back to the shop and Steven was absolutely amazing in that he went above and beyond to retrieve our number! He even rang me on his day off to reassure me that he wouldn't give up and finally after lots of phone calls and intervention on our behalf reinstated my number! I'm still waiting for a refund for the two months that I couldn't use the phone but I again went into the shop on Friday and Steven assured me he was dealing with it on an ongoing basis! And I know he won't let it rest also on Friday Reece was charming and I told him that I couldn't send txt messages anymore so he removed the bar ( although I don't know why it happened in the first place!!!) I still can't send txt to my son's phone so will have to return to the shop when it's convenient for us! Once again a huge thanks to Reece and particularly to Steven for their professionalism and support 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
Albert at the St Albans store understood my technical problem and empathised with my experience. He took time to deal with the issue in a positive and cheerful way. He also separately found me more suitable Plans. A great shopping morning
I bought international minutes and I still charged in December 2022 and overcharged in Jan. and Feb. 2023So bad that I canceled DD.Thanks
Received excellent service from Lucy at Romford very friendly and made us feel confortable and at ease
Ellen in Exeter was an absolute dream to deal with. Been so frustrated with online and Toni she sorted it within minutes. Will definitely be dealing direct in future
"Victor was fantastic in sorting out my problem. Not only patient and knowledgeable, but he went the extra mile in working with the Vodafone tech teams to work out why my issue was occurring. When it looked like it would take longer than expected to fix, he gave me his word that he would resolve the problem and told me that I should head back to work and not spend any more time sitting in the Vodafone store. True to his word, in 90 minutes the problem was resolved. Kind, courteous and apologetic for the problem I had experienced, Victor is obviously great at solving problems."
I purchased a new contact I have new iPhone pro pay over 60 pound a month my phone was had a bad single I contact customer service to resolve the issue the told me we have disconnect you line for 24 hours but now it is 4 days I don’t have any service any the keep telling me within 24 hours
"Ibby, Pooja and Abby were very helpful today in helping me change my 26,000 numbers (as pooja referred to it 😝) I’d highly recommend anyone going to see any of these 3 at Meadowhall rather than calling 191 and being on the phone for an hour and getting hanged up on.Thanks"
"I took my son in to change his phone the two young ladies were extremely helpful, polite and professional. My son has autism/ learning difficulties, the two young ladies were patient and put him at total ease in their company. Thank you to you both."
My data has run out early so I topped up and tried to buy a new bundle with 15 pounds and I'm told I can't until this bundle expires on 02 may. Bloody ridiculous rip off and they want 2 pounds a day for data. Vodafone aren't getting anymore money from me. I'm moving to Voxi Mobile. Much better deals
"My experience buying a new mobile phone in my local Vodafone in Widnes store was really great.The salesman Ash was not pushy, explained all my options available to me and explained very well all options prices and type of phone best for me.I had been in the store a few weeks ago to renew my broadband,and Ash dealt with me then,this is the reason I returned to the store fo purchase a new mobile."
"1. Terrible service - hidden extra charges e.g. charges for sending MMSs, charges for roaming in countries that with other providers are free plus stealth charges e.g. Vodafone Secure Net charges on bills yet service was not requested2. Terrible customer service - impossible to speak to anyone and the AIbot (TOBi chat is awful)3. Increasing prices - regular increases to contract charges4. Poor reception - terrible issues with calls dropping"
All the service advisors were very informative and willing to help with my queries. They definitely made me feel at ease whilst in store.
The store was really helpful and customer service was great.
Purchased an upgrade mobile phone. The lad was very helpful and explained everything to me for my new mobile contract.
Fantastic personal service to someone not very IT aware!
I went into the Cheapside store to enquire about a contract. I was served by Hamide who was very friendly and took me through all the options available. She made sure she explained everything to me in detail and her cutsomer service skills are excellent.
"I came in this afternoon and got served by Qasim, he dealt with my query in a timely manner and made sure I left the store happier than when I arrived."
Both Ryan and Kieron were fabulous when I had a problem with my data package.Problem sorted and advice given which was very appreciated. Many thanks to the fabulous team at Vodafone Hanley Stoke on Trent
"Went to the Store on April 15th & Manager Anthony, very helpful gentleman, set up a SIM free airtime plan. Did live chat on the 18th with a query totally unrelated to payment plans & about an hour of trying to get answers signed off. Checked account but for some inexplicable reason my airtime plan had been changed back to the previous more expensive plan. Went back on live chat & after being transferred to 4 different people gave up at 9 : 30 PM.Went to Store today & excellent staff member Zee sorted everything out back to the SIM free plan.There's an obvious moral to the story."
"Having come to the end of a 2 year contract with Vodafone I popped into my local store to see what they could do for me after 2 years of very high bills. Steven and Hayley were absolutely brilliant. I was so grateful to them both as their priority was ‘what was the best service for me as the customer’ not ‘what was the most expensive plan they could sell’. They checked through my account and identified a tablet that had been on my account for 4 years that I haven’t used for a very long time. They adjusted my plan and my monthly payments have gone from £168 to £35.50!!!! That is a monthly saving of £131.50!!!! Thank you so much Steven and Hayley, I’m so grateful and will be back to see you again. Brilliant service. Highly recommend the Poole store!!!!"
Kered was very helpful and knew his stuff. Would 100% want this guys efforts recognised by his manager! Maybe a bonus or a bottle of whisky!
"Tahar was absolutely brilliant,engaging and helpful!.Glad I decided to move to Vodafone."
Good deal and helpful Owner who helped me transfer all my data onto my new phone whilst saving me over £25 a month on my business account
Abi was really helpful and sorted everything I needed doing to a good degree
Fantastic account lead in Sherman and manager great too.
The guys at the North shields store have been fantastic. I couldn't have asked for more. They gave me exactly what I needed. Perfect. Thank you.
"I have just cancelled my broadband and will soon cancel all phone contracts. Poor service overall, outsourced call staff incapable of thinking outside the box or divulging from the script, the speeds never once over the two years matched my guaranteed speed and they make it extremely time consuming and inconvenient to cancel.   Switched over to Virgin, half the price and 3x as fast."
Simon and Kevin were extremely helpful and patient while we discussed different options.
It is all about kindness and respectThat what I have experienced with Matthew from Bolton.Even I go a similar deal from EEBut what matter for me is the welcoming atmosphere.Thank you Vodafone for your customer service.Regards
"Bam was polite and efficient, explaining saving to contract"
"Ian helped throughout the process and great offer, better handset and better price."
"Member of staff was really helpful when I was considering phone options. Unlike some other mobile phone shops, when nobody seems to want to offer help unless asked, the lady in this shop was happy to offer options. I believe the fantastic lady I spoke to, was called Tracy (she was possibly even the manageress), but was able to assist when you have so many choices to make.This was in the Gyle Centre, near Edinburgh."
Kennedy did an excellent job and was helpful setting everything up...
"Was served by Ravi he was very helpful, very professional and a credit to the company, I highly recommend his service"
Received great service from Farhan at the White Rose store. Found me a cheaper deal with a better phone. Thanks.
"Vodafone has just cost me a large business dealI have a business account.  My business involves international calls.  I organised several days in advance to have 100 minutes of international calls added to my account so I could make a particular call.  Unfortunately,this was not done and a barrier was placed on my account instead.  Customer service wherever they where did not seem able to understand the problem this caused and were very reluctant to pass on the complaint to a manager.I lost the deal."
Went into store today with a broken phone and wanted to buy a new one and get the data transferred. I know practically nothing about phones and Zara could not have been more helpful or patient! She was incredibly knowledgeable and explained so much to me. Zara is a definite asset to the Vodafone team.
Tahar is very good with customer's I came in one day to stop a contact and I was with my ex misses and she was really rude to him while he was trying to help us  he is a credit to be working for you I will recommend all my mates and people to Vodafone
The young lady who dealt with me today was very helpful she explained everything clearly she was very pleasent and lovely
"AGAIN, Cant log in...Been logged out of my account again after ONE try.This as happened time and time again.My contract finished on the 1st April 2023 so itsTIME TO GO. Will be leaving as soon as Ive found a better one. (shouldn't be hard)UPDATE:- Thanks for thr reply butNo thanksDon't do social media."
Terrible phone company i taken out a contract within a month they have up the bill be 4.30 a month already so next year that could happen again absolute robbery and a scam no reason for that price inflation  . Will definitely cancel asap
"Rajen was extremely patient, knowledgeable and helpful - I feel completely confident in his expertise.  Thank you Rajen!!"
The staff James and Natalie were brilliant. Explained everything so that I could understand it. Friendly and happy to serve us.
"Jabs in the preston store was brilliant, very knowledgable, infact áll the staff were great and friendly, strongly recommend the preston store. Thank you."
Very helpful staff. Gertrude was amazing helping me find the best plan for travelling and gave great advice.
"Cannot thank the team at Bluewater Vodafone for their help reducing my monthly costs and sorting out my new contract and phone. Amy in particular was fabulous and made sure everything went through smoothly after I attempted the purchase the day before, but was unable to complete due to credit department issues. Amy gave the breakdown of everything I was agreeing to and ensuring that everything stated the day before was replicated and did an amazing job of putting though the sale."
I was genuinely assisted by Arslam whom very promptly and politely solved my issues!!
It’s rubbish it does not work no signal for 8 hours everyday is driving me madI just paid £297 to cancel it early
"Visited store today, the guy who helped me was very helpful and solved a few issues quickly."
I came to complain about my service and came very angrily but the boy with curly hair helped me I think his name was pamir and decided to stay with Vodafone. I so sorry they young man’s name was pamir in Holborn branch
Great service from Moin store manager. Happy with quick easy process
Moved over to Vodafone after experiencing great customer in store with Becca
"Nice and friendly staff, especially Becca"
"Very slow customer service, they're only interested if you're buying a new phone"
The customer service was amazing our server MO was very patient during the whole process
"I had a disappointing experience with Vodafone's service while attempting to sign up for one of their Full Fibre deals. As a new customer, I was initially reassured by both Vodafone and their partner CityFibre that my address was suitable for installation. After waiting for two weeks, I received a message on the very last working day before the scheduled installation date, informing me that my order had been cancelled with no explanation provided.Upon contacting customer support, I had to spend nearly an hour seeking clarification. Eventually, I was told that CityFibre had determined it was not possible to install broadband at my property.Customer support then suggested using OpenReach instead (why wasn't this the default from the beginning I have no clue), but this would require waiting an additional two weeks for an engineer's visit and forfeiting the new customer perks, such as a gift card.At this point, I decided to cancel my order and look for a different provider. Any other provider will be better I'm sure. My experience with Vodafone has been less than ideal, and I encourage others to explore alternative options with better customer service."
Shelby was very helpful and quickly sorted out my new phone to the spec I needed
Why cant every vodafone store provide What a fantastic store!!!!I went into enquire about broadband and ended up buying because of the absolute politeness and knowledge of Claire.Thank you Claire
Selena was very helpful and obliging very helpful
"I always enjoy coming into this shop as the consultants are very friendly and extremely helpful; especially Dan, Yasmin and Azaan."
"Tasmia was fabulous. Very friendly, warm and chatty while being very efficient. She know about the probity’s available and was able to advise. Her technical know-how was first class. Excellent service."
I was served by James. The best service have received in years! This guy is amazing.
"Ibby was great, put a lot of time and effort ensuring that I got the correct deal for me at a brilliant price. Despite being new to the team, customer service was impeccable. Very nice to have a knowledgeable salesman without being pushed to complete the sale. Thanks Ibby."
"Spent hours trying to cancel my upgraded broadband.Passed from dept to dept and still no further in after hours.To renew or take out the contract was perfect but customer services seem non existent when you need to cancel! very disappointed with Vodafone.  Used to be amazing customer service.Updated, managed to get through to a really helpful advisor who understood and fixed the problem.  Need more guys like this!"
Lyla was extremely helpful in the bolton store. Didn't try to push a brand new top end phone contract on my mum she recognised what she uses it for and was extremely helpful and professional. Thanks so much!
"Excellent service, thoughtful and very helpful in sorting out new phone and services, very knowledgeable, thank you Sam"
"Bad customer services. My internet was not working for 1 week. Spend hours with the customer service to resolve the issue, no luck, then they booked an ‘engineer’. The engineer supposed to come on Saturday between 1Pm and 6pm. No show at all, no communication. The customer service told me someone will contact you for compensation and complaint. It’s been more than 2 weeks no one contact me in that regard. The internet is still breaking out. Awful service"
"Mitch was wonderful, so helpful and informative. He obviously knows the Vodafone products very well."
"Arif was excellent, he knows his stuff about Vodafone"
Absolutely smoo
Deniz was very patient and helped me with my phone and explained everything very well
Fred was great got a new phone and he helped me transfer my data

We popped into our local Sudbury store and received an excellent service from Ash and Luke.  We had many changes and upgrades to make which also enabled savings.  Thank you.
Very friendly and professional did everything I asked for
"Dan, who dealt with me has been here for years. This gives a great sense of continuity. He is always friendly and constructive and this was also true of this visit. I am delighted the Vodaphone shop is here and so accessible."
Purchased a new Samsung S23 Ultra from the Huddersfield store. Everything went smoothly throughout the transaction and every care was taken to understand my needs and make sure I was comfortable including a cup of coffee. Both Henry and Jonny were extremely helpful.
Great help and speedy service from Beauty at Kings Road.
"Brilliant staff,excellent advice,perfect service,sorted my phone service ,10/10"
"Helpful, friendly staff.  Genuinely felt like they were trying to get us the best deal."
As a long standing loyal customer to vodaphone i would like to thank the 2 staff in my local shop for assisting me with an upgrade There was a few issues and concerns i had regarding now having to pay an upfront fee and alsio no plug supplied with the phone but this was out of the staffs hands They did a good job in convincing me to stay with vodaphone so well done to them and thank you for all your help
"I went into make an enquiry about my bill, the service was great, very helpful with this old man and ended up making a saving on my contract. Great service and great staff. Many thanks."
"Extremely helpful and polite service from ‘Freddie’, made the experience much easier and quicker than I had anticipated it would be."
Wasn’t too sure what to expect with vodaphone but I was pleasantly surprised. Sam in the Southampton store went above and beyond.
"When I came into the store, Fred was super helpful and gave me options on a new contract. His knowledge made everything so understandable and made my trip to the store worth while.Thanks Fred"
Brilliant experience with Dan in Vodafone Elgin
"Bradley in Hereford store was extremely helpful, saved me money on my plan, changed the plan and looked at every viable option for me. He’s a credit to Vodafone"
"Rick h was excellent, brilliant service   Explained everything, very happy."
Sam was amazing. Really helped me and got me the best price for what I needed.
Lots of thanks on  the Assistant Manager Abs for helping me with setting up my device and the Vodafone account. Abs has demonstrated a high level of professionalism.
Mo was brilliant. Thank you
"Sadly I was with Vodafone for more than 15 years! Yesterday, 19/4/23 I was brought to my attention that for 3 years I was ripped off of by Vodafone ! My multiple attempts trying to get connected with a manager from customer service failed. All the assistants work in Egypt so i automatically connect to  them. But when I ask to transfer them to the management department in customer service they refused to do so. instead they are using their sweet talk by contradicting everything you were told before by someone else.  Perhaps this deceiving method was implanted by the management ? How else can you explain NO possibility to get in touch with head office in Newbury: no tel number exists, no emails. In the end of the day all  these useless conversations with Egypt assistances end up in lies. Yesterday I stoped at high street Vodafone shop and by pure coincidence I met Ankur who is the supervisor of all London shops. He explained that from 2021 I was charged £10 per month plus service charge until today for international bundle calls!  Though I was explained from 2021 by the same Egypt assistants that this was only 1 time purchase and if I don’t use all my minutes I could use them again when ever I want with no charge.  when my international bundle will be stoped  it will not allow me to make another call abroad automatically- this is how I know when the bundle is used up.  At the same time I am learning that my recently call to Georgia for 9 minutes was charged £6.00! I remember very well how it all stared in 2020.I had to make a few international calls to Europe from London and I called my provider- Vodofone and asked if they can offer any service. I explained that I only need to make these calls about 3 times a year.  The agent offered £3. 00 bundle for 100 minutes 1 time ( not ongoing !) I could renew any time after using 100 minutes if I wish. I agreed and used it from time to time during the year. Then I was informed that the price has changed and now they have £10 per bundle for 500 minutes with the same rules. I agreed again , only not knowing that behind my back I was charging for 3 years £10 per month ! What a scam !   when ever I noticed that my bill was higher than usual I would  contact Vodafone and the agents  would sweetly apologised and say that will correct this matter and will send me credit.  But in the reality all these was false. I am asking to refund £10 per month for 3 years plus service charges that I paid on it. Plus £ 6 for the Georgia call in Europe!"
I wouldn’t even give Vodafone one star but as I see it’s the lowest I can give.It’s now Wednesday the 19th and I still haven’t heard from you or anyone of your team. I’m not surprised to be honest as your priorities aren’t really focused on your customers are they let’s be truthful. I still keep receiving emails and text messages stating I’m due to upgrade though I wish you would stop. My intention is now focused on another provider as you clearly have shown no interest in calling me  plus being a long time customer stands for NOTHING.So now I stop the direct debit and I’m sure you’ll probably but I’m not 100% sure you’ll contact me sooner than later. J. Dyson
Told via text and email when I requested STAC code by ETF would be £45.77.Received my final bill and charged £71.61 for ETF.I have a complaint in against Vodafone. I'm just wait for response.CISAS and Ofcom informed I'm no longer with Vodafone and no longer have that number.
"Extremely helpful, friendly, knowledgeable and professional. Highly recommend the service I received."
Resolved issue quickly and efficiently and staff was very friendly.
"The service was great, very helpful and friendly. Abi was lovely and solved the issue quickly and effectively."
"very bad service, unfair monthly raises and unrealistic terms and conditions. Can't believe they raised the mothly cost by over 13.5% on a contract which includes a phone: unjustified and without even sending a notification. I'd rather pay a high exit fee but not having anything to do with them"
Zero stars. Been with vodafone for more than 10 years. Would not do a deal to renew contract. No loyalty to customers so went to Asda mobile and they have been fab. Vodafone sort yourself out
"I went into my local branch today and was served by Will who couldn’t have been more helpful and professional. I went in having had continued problems with my Apple Watch connectivity but was also considering an upgrade. Will was able to confidently assist with all my phone needs  but most importantly promptly. I came away with a new contract, fixed Apple Watch and cheaper contract, a very happy customer and I couldn’t recommend him more! Thanks."
"Amazing Service from Jilani, fully explained my new plan what I was eligible for complete difference service to what I got on the phone, I would recommend everyone going in brunch and visiting Jilani as he gave me amazing service."
"Excellent experience in Vodaphone shop at Felixstowe.Everything was explained so we could understand, without being patronising.Cole was very professional in his dealings with us, and seemed to offer us decent deals.We came away very happy.A score of 10/10 is well deserved."
Broadband connection ‘engineer’ expected today between 8am and 1pm. No show by 1pm so called Vodafone to be told ‘engineer’ running late but will attend before 6pm. No show by 6pm so further call to Vodafone. Apologetic but offering unsuitable appointments a week hence. Finally offered and accepted a new appointment 2 weeks hence. The point is we had to make all the running with zero communication from Vodafone during the day. Not a good start to our new broadband relationship with Vodafone. On the plus side the Vodafone customer person did their best.
Super lovely staff and extremely helpful!
"Updated my handset and contract today at the St Albans branch with Ahmer, Jabar and Albert. They were all super upbeat, helpful and friendly - just what’s needed on a grey Wednesday. Thanks team!"
"Brilliantly effective and helpful service from the manager of the store. He quickly sorted a problem connecting my Apple Watch to my phone that two calls to Vodafone's call centre failed to fix (wasting about 1.5 hours!). A nice, smart guy - Vodafone needs more of them."
"Bo and Gulherme sorted me out with an additional line on my contract, wicked experience, brilliant customer service"
The employee  Connor was great very funny and explained everything brilliantly
"I had a billing issue which wasn't resolved over the phone, so I came in store and got served by Adam, who sat with me to resolve this situation. Adam was absolutely fantastic and helped me to the best of his ability. I couldn't of walked out happier."

"Order number: WEB-0001000027829027Luckily i called to check to see if anything will go ahead. My broadband is suppose to be activated today. I called and gave order number which was placed on 3rd April. Vodafone telling me the order hasnt gone through, I received all the relevant emails confirm the order and even the Hub turned up. Now they want me to place a new order, which will result in a new activation date. Vodafone staff acting like its my fault and tell me i have two options even i do the order or they re do the order. Why hasnt no one contacted me to let me know there was an issue? Awful service."
"Ionut was patient and helpful, with great customer service"
"I was a little bit nervous going into the shop. I wasn’t sure what to expect. I had a problem with my phone which was dealt with very quickly. The person who greeted me fixed it in a few seconds. He then took me to another advisor who did more in-depth checks which reassured me. They did a great job, thanks Steve and the team."
Very helpful. Matt helped me out today and was very clear and made everything understandable.

My current Vodafone contract finishes this month. I’ve just come to the Vodafone shop at Meadowhall for advice hoping to carry on with this phone but wondering if I would be better with a new one. I was expertly advised by Abi who explained the different options and as this phone is working perfectly I decided to keep it. She explained that I could review this decision in 3 months if I wanted. I was very pleased with the new contract which gives me 6GB a month for £18. I had previously been paying £47.Thanks so much to Abi for her efficiency and advice in helping me today.
Kingdroad Vodafone Store.  My visit wad geser and Quick.  VOXI renewal. Beauty Made it so easy.  Thank you
"Upgraded in Jan 23, Vodafone then stopped the wrong direct debit, then transferred my case to a debt collection agency after id proved it was their fault. Terrible company, hours on the phone on hold and the cannot sort out a simple mistake they have made."
"Avoid at all costI went in to see what's on offer as I'm out of contract with EE. The polish man was not interested one bit. He was rude and kept on telling me there's nothing he can do. He even answered his phone and started speak in polish while he was talking to me, that's how interested he was in serving me.I'm glad I didn't join Vodafone, because if that's the kind of people they have working there, then can you imagine if I went in with a problem."
"Naz was very helpful, very knowledgable and very friendly."
Help with connection with data at Vodafone in Elgin
"Fantastic experience this morning from the guys at the Parkgate store, no problem too big, explained everything perfectly and even sorted me out a new laptop, big shoutout to James who sorted everything for me, cheers"
Great customer service. Would recommend to my friends.
I was served by amin and junior. Excellent service delighted with the first class attention I recieve every time I come in. I cannot praise your staff highly enough they are a credit to your organisation.
"James, Scott & Lucas all contributed to make my visit to the store worthwhile. The level of customer service they offered was brilliant and so rare these days"
"Worst of the worst company I've ever had to deal with for customer services. They keep over charging me by over double for my bill!! After many polite conversations with customer services, they are apologetic, but do not do anything to fix it! How can a company of this size get it so wrong?NEVER USE VODAFONE!!(this is my worst experience with a company, and I hardly ever complain about anything)"
Went in store to fix my phone as the screen wasnt turning on. The guys in the atore were brilliant and it was fixed very quickly. Highly recommended this store for there efficiency
I went in to upgrade my phone spoke with Steve who was great and very knowledgeable
Went in to do an upgrade as my bill was too much after the price increase. The staff was lovely and josh was very helpful and the knowledge he had on iPhone was brilliant
"have spent over 4 hours trying to speak to someone tonight, my issue has not been given an explanation, I was offered a goodwiil gesture!!!!! A VOUCHCHER FOR A FREE SMALL COFFEE AT COSTA yes you read that correct what an insult, I also found out thata security code set by default is my year of birth are they serious and that there is a number code which in my case is 190180 I dont know this date BUT HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF FORGEETING IT I dont know it so would not have set it, dont call the number for complaints that starts with 0808 because it is not a dedicated complaints number as given"
"So good to have a signal after being stuck with 3 and the worst signal ever for 2 years. So far so good, its felt brilliant being able to pick up my phone and it works,same phone just now pay as you go and different network."
I canceled my contract in January and found out today my contract was not cancelled by vodafone as requested and they had been billing me and passed onto a debt collection agency for £120.When trying to get though to vodafone I was put onto multiple staff who had poor English skills to do the job as I had to keep repeating myself over and over again.I will never use vodafone again and will let my family and friends know not to use themWhat's even worse I have been with Vodafone for 4 years and they have just gone down hillAdvice vodafone listen to your customers and improve in the customer service you provide. Also a email to customer service would be better then sitting on a call for 40 minites. No one wants to do that and emailing is so much easier.
"I had very good experience with Julie who was a very friendly person, she was very patiently helping me to get most suitable plan and help me to insert new SIM card, choosing good phone number for me. A lovely staff can brighten the whole shop. Thank you Julie, thank you Vodafone Kidderminster.A happy customer: Sherry"
"Ryan is nice , perfect vodafone employ, very helpul and nice guy."
"I went in looking to upgrade my phone, Pav gave me a great deal. Later I had issues trying to get my old number switched over to my new sim, so I went back in and within 5 minutes Pav sorted it out for me. Friendly and professional service"
Was on contract with them regularly before never had a price increase. Under 6 months in and they have increased my price only because I took a mobile with them. Recommend not taking a mobile contract. Also was given a faulty phone which heats up and apparently they say nothing is wrong with it
Staff were very helpful and swiftly sorted my new phone. In and out in 20 minutes.
Sam was great. Very happy with service.
"Prolonged awful service,I chose not to renew my service at the end of the contract, called well before the required time to inform them of this and was told that the line will be cancelled. I was then charged a further two times after my contract had ended and even then charged a non payment fee! I've now called three times to get this sorted and still I have not been reimbursed.I was informed that all money would be returned to me by the first person (please go ahead and check your recordings) then the second said only a partial refund and the third didn't have a clue about any of it. So far I have received 0.83p back, is this some sort of joke? Utterly woeful and I'm not even a customer anymore!"
"i bought phone from vodofone 2 years ago. when my contrack finish they still charge me phone as well. i called them and they said ""you need to call us before your contart finish"". they stole my 2 months money and did not give refund."
"All I wanted to do was change the my Direct debit details. I have now wasted over seven hours over two days and I am still trying to acheive this simple thing.We have been customers for over 20 years and have not moved in that time, and have good credit.Firstly trying on line, I was told to call them, three departments and over three hours later I was told to send in ID. It was acepted and I though I have achieved my goal, but no. When I looked at my bank account some money was still being taken from my old account.Optomistically  I thought it might now be possible to correct this online, but oh now. So I made a complaint.Today again I have wasted over four hours, waiting for calls that didn't happen, and I have now received an email saying my ID wasn't accepted, SO WHY DID THEY CHANGE THE DIRECT DEBIT FOR THE AIR TIME but not the Device payment. Unbelievable!"
"Michael was a very nice guy, very informative and very thorough, he explained all the deals and terms, very efficient member of your staff, came away very happy.😃"
Service is here very good all stuff is very good specially mirza

Mark was absolutely amazing. He was very helpful and enthusiastic. He explained clearly and got me the best deal possible with future information presented to me for future better deals
The manager Dylan was very quick and easy to communicate with while he helped me choose the right upgrade that would suit my needs.
LExcellent couldnt do enough for me chet
"Zack was so helpful at the Thanet store, got me a great deal and really listened to my needs"
"Really friendly, helpful approachable people at the Alton store today. Thank you. A breath of fresh air after Farnham!"
Great service - very helpful.
Do not buy a Samsung Z4 fold from Vodafone because if the screens fail it will cost you £600!!Mine has the 2 black screen issue and even though I've only had it since September 2022 it's not covered under warranty. Apparently Samsung will not cover screen repairs according to Vodafone. Absolutely disgusting. My next phones not going to be a Samsung nor will it be from Vodafone.
"Guppi was very helpful and informative. I felt he helped me get the best sim only deal. As a first time Vodafone customer, i was very impressed with the service guppi gave me."
Lusi at Swindon branch was v v helpful & friendly! Especially as I had elderly parents’ phones to sort! She has been so v supportive! She should be commended! A grateful customerx
"Lost my phone. Called into the Macclesfield Vodafone store. Patrick sorted me out with a replacement SIM and proof of usage forms in rapid time. Friendly, knowledgeable staff member"
"Absolutely brilliant service as always, haven't ever had a problem, friendly staff and very chatting and helped with everything we needed."
Lovely customer service. Explained evergthing in detail. Assett to your company
"11/10 fantastic service from all advisers in store. Cellan, Emily and Neil were all professional and very helpful. Especially Cellan who I was made aware is a new starter."
"I am very surprised to see this review as I didn't write myself, your staff Maria wrote this herself when she collected my phone in disguise of helping me."
"Visited store today to get a phone account for our youngest son. Katy looked after us and was really friendly, explained everything really well and got us the best deal. She also answered all of our questions easily. Katy is a credit to Vodafone"
Excellent service and so humble staff. Really appreciate.
I was served by Amin today and i have to say i am impressed with how calmly he explained my options to me. At our age technology is a no go glad we had Amin to take on the headache of both devices and us oldies
"Went into Church st store on 18th April to change and upgrade my Samsung android phone. The Sales chap called Tom was just brilliant, I explained that I needed the new iphone as I am profoundly deaf and have new bluetooth hearing aids that work best with an iphone. Wow this chap has been so helpful as I have lots of photos etc and he has helped to download/ transfer all of these for me. I cannot thank him enough, so professional and knowledgeable about the phones and what will work best for me.If I could I would give this chap 5*****"
Very helpful explained everything excellent  customer service
Michael from Farnborough was very kind and always give or offer so many options the customer can have
"Completely horrific - the single worst company in the world. I have tried a number of times to cancel an old phone contract - the contract was a 2 year agreement. After the 2 year period elapses, it is apparently in Vodafone’s T&C’s that the contract simply keeps running until you call to cancel. I have called to cancel on 4 separate occasions, and am then told that I have a balance with a DEBT COLLECTION AGENCY?! This means that I am unable to cancel. I then call the debt collection agency, and they tell me that my balance is completely different to what Vodafone do. I have now overpaid on the account by over £600. To make matters worse, the customer service agents couldn’t even “find” the account that I apparently owe money on. Complete and utter shambles that has destroyed my credit rating. I wish to raise a formal complaint, and receive compensation for the irreparable damage caused by Vodafone to my credit rating."
Vodafone Farnborough I’ve been set for Michael and has been fantastic and yeah I’m very pleased thank you
"Excellent service and patience to help an elderly lady,  they sorted out all my problems with careful instructions - as well as humour!  Enjoyed my visit!!"
"Tomas goncalves from the Vodafone store in gravesend gave me the best customer service and he was very friendly, knowledgeable and helpful and the gravesend store is the best Vodafone store I have been too 10/10 service."
"Encountered a technical issue with daughters phone. She is a vulnerable adult and her phone is her lifeline. Staff in Kirkcaldy shop were superb, especially Ashleigh and Thomas. They kept in touch, contacting me daily to update. Also chased technical support daily. Eventually a disconnect and reconnect. Resolved after 8 days. Staff were patient, understanding and explained step by step what was required.  Also checked daughters phone daily to monitor settings, changes etc. Ensured she had phone service at all times. Great customer service"
Staff extremely helpful and knowledgeable ( Andy and Sean ) very helpful
"Kimberley of Camberley very conscientious, helpful and caring. George Lambert"
"The staff in the shop at Sittingbourne were very helpful, and understanding. Shelbie helped with my issue quickly and effectively."
Service quality by Jamal in Farnborough.
Absolutely appalling.Given misleading information and breaching the contract. Spent many many hours on the phone trying to process a complaint through to them and got no where other than failed promises and further misleading information.I will be cancelling with them at any chance I get after being with them for so long and giving them the benefit of the doubt. They will not accept liability of their actions even though I have stated numerous legislations they are within breach of.Waste of time and a waste of a company.
It eda evet good he helped me a lot and it was a good experience
Good experience Caio set up my Samsung

Vodaphone Northwich store was served by Kerry she was brilliant got me the best data deal explained everything no surprise i knew exactly what my bill would be how long my contract was for all this with excellent customer service and a smile
Thanks Kevin at Vodafone Macclesfield for my upgrade. Excellent service today.
Lottie and Dan of the Tonbridge store were very helpful and efficient. I got exactly what I wanted
"Update on 26/4/2023: once again technical problem!!! third time already! I’m so angry!Is that the problem will only be fixed and I can have my internet in the new home AFTER the 2-year contract finished!? Or NEVER!?I absolutely won’t trust Vodafone anymore!What a horrible company! Applied for broadband moving to new home weeks ago, talked to the customer service twice and was confirmed twice, but application was still suddenly cancelled with no reason nor even any notice. We checked the status before we noticed that “the order cancelled”! Again!What’s wrong with this company? Vodafone supposed to be the largest and well developed company I thought! (Am I wrong?!) It’s such a simply and common thing for moving broadband to new home, but Vodafone make things so complicated. We hope we could avoid this company but we have contract! What s shame!And we don’t know when we can have our broadband done in our new home!!"
"Alan was fantastic, helping this an old damsel in distress! Thank you"
Mo did a fantastic job. Fantastic job fantastic staff
"Fantastic service, listened to my needs and offered different ideas for me going forward and improving the plans I have and upgrading. Not pushy at all, explained everything clearly. Leaving the store very happy."
"Service was quick and efficient, got exactly what I wanted and even got it cheaper than I expected"
"Hi, today I had the pleasure to meet Andreea in Vodafone Northampton store, and she is very professional, explained all details clearly and made me understand what is best for my new contact"
Visited Michael in Vodafone Farnborough.and I asked him for some help and was so so happy with his help to me about my issues.
"I was greeted with a smile, Joel was very patient and helped me with a new phone at the Southend high street store."
"I have been with Vodafone for several years now and have finally switched to Giffgaff - when my first Vodafone contract expired, I was wooed back in with a discount and a Spotify premium package. The contract is incredibly expensive, it is difficult to get hold of decent customer service as the virtual assistant is impossible, the MyVodafone app is useless and the benefits non-existent, and connecting my Spotify was far more hassle than it was worth - I wish I hadn't done it. I am paying a third of the price with Giffgaff for the same amount of data, texts & calls - this switch was prompted by an email from Vodafone stating my bill was going to increase by over £5, when it was already breathtakingly high, and with a 15% discount for resigning with them. I can't imagine a scenario in which Vodafone is worth choosing over another provider and would avoid at all costs."
"Lost my phone. Panicked like bonkers. Vodafone Elgin and Daniel were spectacularly helpful, professional, reassuring and perfect"
"Very helpful guy Bradley at the Macclesfield shop, plus he saved me some money."
Im not a patient person but mo was really patient and give me a really good service and he have also a good communication skills and thank u again for being patient with me 🤝🏾🤝🏾
"Vodafone Corporate Services are a JokeI hold a monthly sim from Vodafone and want to transfer it to a company account. After submitting all the needed forms they came to say the company is dormant lol, which is trading and stated as active in the companies house. I reached out and clarified again but they said this is what our credit company says and that I have to contact them to change that lol again. I tried to contact them and since I don't have an account with a company I don't know what it is actually they couldn't help. I tried again to contact vodafone and still waiting for their update"
"Lexy is such a nice person, she is really helpful!"
Alex was fab! He sorted everything we needed in such a short time and was very friendly and helpful :) Vodafone Ipswich.
"Called in to the Fareham branch as always helpful ,Jimmy who helped me with my Sumsung and also talked about broadband for my new house. The Service was excellent, definitely wouldn't go any where else ,will be back when my contract comes to a end .It's very hard to get great customer service nowadays. Jimmy is certainly an expert in his job and passion about it.What a asset to Vodafone Thanks very much"
Excellent customer service by Claire in your Livingston store.
"After weeks of trying to get a new router as I haven't had a steady connection for a month now, Vodafone signed me up for a mobile broadband connection at extra charge which I didn't request. I've had to spend hours on the phone being pinged over from one department to the other with everyone clueless as to what is going on or able to help. Shocking service all around!***Update*** They now sent a router to the wrong address twice. This debacle with Vodafone continues, still no service after close to 4 weeks. How is a business supposed to function?"
"I explicitly asked for my sim-only contract to be cancelled within the cooling-off period (14-days). I received an email on the day of cancelling saying, ""Sorry to let you go"" but because of some small print with the PAC code, I was charged the full 24 months (£590). The customer service is based overseas and not very helpful. When I asked for a recording of the initial cancellation call they make it extremely difficult for me to access the recording file. I would never ever go near this business or recommend them to anybody who I know."
Fantastic service from Sam and Jack and all the Team at Kings Lynn - excellent! Many thanks
"I was with Vodafone for years renewed contract march 2023 had nothing but problems ,I had to get another provider because of health conditions I had to be able to be reached by medical specialist etc I put a complaint to Vodafone,they advise you to make a complaint through CISAS and independent adjudicator what a joke, that is ,they have to be working for vodaphone,I was told to return my phone to the store I did and was videoed doing so for proof ,but Vodafone and CISAS did not find this important ,I in my 60s and between voday and CISAS the independent adjudicator has ruined my good credit for something I don't have because vodaphone told me to return to the store they are a joke ,ofcom won't help it's time the public no how bad they are ,look at the terrible  reviews of CISAS who are linked with Vodafone only way to stop this is to make sure people don't go to Vodafone and spread over social media these legalised crooks only no one thing and that is greed stop spending money on Vodafone and wasting time contacting CISAS I have every screen shot on these sites it's time to stop them getting away with this I'm still getting bills for the phone I returned last year .please try get your friends not to renew with vodaphone,I have got a message from the Vodafone social media to check my account for the phone I don't have but being charged for also being allowed to ruin my credit ,they want me to contact them on Facebook I don't use ,or twitter I don't use why can't they check my issues out instead of making comments to try make them look like they care ,why should I do more to give them proof ,videos via Cesas and spend hours upon hours trying to clear this joke of a debt , Vodafone don't care ,they wish me to contact them through 2 means of contact I don't have ,why can't they look in to my problem rectify it then contact me ,please please do not use Vodafone,they don't care about anyone, only ££££££££££££££"
"Entered into 24 months contract had the worst experience of my life with Vodafone. We bought their premium package, the most expensive one, and it has been nothing but headaches from day 1. First of all they did not deliver their equipment to us for when we moved in, and we spent a month without internet. This was in early December and Vodafone kept making untraceable manual request to have the equipment delivered, overwriting previous requests every time we called and ended up not having the internet equipment for a whole month until the next year. I had to call so many times it must have added up to at least 24 hours in calls or chats to vodafone to resolve this issue. It ruined the holidays for us - we couldn't play music or watch movies as is our family tradition. Then within a couple of weeks the internet stop working for almost all of our devices. We could only use web browser but most applications did not function. We couldn't use my phone apps, the X-Box, or watch streaming services on the laptop. We tried to contact Vodafone to resolve this issue but waiting times were so long it was hard to find help. After 2-3 attempts at fixing, vodafone finally identified a software issue with their modem and fixed it. Now just over a month after resolving the previous issue we are again facing the same problems with numerous apps not working. Again with the Smart-TV, many computer-based apps, and our X-Box having connectivity issues. All these devices work fine when connected to 4G on the phone so clearly the fault here is with Vodafone. Overall disgraceful experience, we pay more than 50 pounds a month (which has already gone up 14% since we signed up just a couple of months ago) to have spotty connection that doesn't function. Half the devices don't work on it, and we are forced to spend eons on the phone or via chat to resolve issues that constantly reappear."
"Great experience, nice members if staff"
The store was amazing and clean.The sales rep Vaishal was amazing is master of his craft helped us to choose the best option available.
"Bought iphone 13, sales rep explained the plans and helped us to decide."
"Warning to anybody thinking of switching or signing up with Vodafone.Even after complaining again, they have cut off my phone service. DO NOT SIGN ANY CONTRACT WITH Vodafone Broadband or phone. They cannot deal with any issues that arise."
"Have spent more than 20-30 hours with customer service in a month.  People not doing their job, not providing correct information, promised phone calls back that never happen, advisors having to wait over two hours to speak to managers that do absolute nothing for good customer service. AVOID TAKING OUT A MOBILE CONTRACT AND MOST DEFINITELY BROADBAND! You are paying them to give you more issues and waste your time. Disappointing and shocking service after being a customer for ten years! Will be leaving as soon as I can! Time is precious!Update two days later-was called and offered more mobile data for the price plan and then receive an email for my ‘new contract plan’ with a price increase I did not agree too. Have to call them again to sort this out… absolutely UNBELIEVABLE! STAY AWAY FROM VODAPHONE!!!!!! Complete time wasters and zero compensation/accountability/customer loyalty!!!"
Excellent customer service from all the staff at Peckham.They all went above and beyond to help me with my query. I would like to say a special thank you to Hana who served me as well as Lucas and to the manager Steve.
Spent 4 hours on the phone with Vodafone and they gave me access to the trouble ticket.  Not one single word of my complaint recorded.   Even worse than TT.
The single worst customer service I have ever experienced.It’s almost as if their staff are trained to lie. Every single conversation I’ve had with them has later transpired to be full of lies. Avoid these clowns at all costs. Even their complaints department lies. You couldn’t actually make it up. 3 months and over 10 phone calls (each takes at least an hour because they’re so incompetent) and they’re still telling me lies.
Exception service received from Mariyam who has assisted with several of my queries.
"DO NOT SWITCH YOUR BROADBAND TO VODAFONE. We agreed to switch to Vodafone a month ago and an engineer was booked to attend to affect this change a week ago. No one attended. Openreach engineers attended 3 days later and informed me that there was an issue and Vodafone had allocated the incorrect port. Since then, following meetings with Openreach engineers and hours spent on the phone to Vodafone technical support, we are still without broadband and receiving conflicting reports from Openreach and Vodafone with each blaming one and other. The latest advice from Vodafone is that it will take them another week to rebuild the connection. All being well this means we will be without broadband for TWO WEEKS!APPALLING SERVICE."
"Aasam was absolutely briliant, he îs an asset to the company and helped me with my account  issues"
I wanted to cancel my broadband and I they told me I’m in a contract I never agreed to. They said they would listen to recordings and call me back. I called 3 times and every single one I have to spend 1 hour talking to someone that has no idea what I’m talking about and hear how they assured me again someone call me back. Honestly they should be assumed besides it’s illegal to put someone on a contract without their consent. Been with them for 3 years and all I get is problem after problem. Thank god I’m leaving so won’t have to deal with them ever again.
"This is the 2nd time I've been to this store,(The Fort) and I can only say the service is fantastic, great friendly  atmosphere, very welcoming, everyone welcomes you, JR & Lauren have been fantastic both spent time explaining everything  to me as I'm not the greatest at technology. Thanks you guys your the best."
Rebecca was very helpful today in helping me get a good deal on a new upgrade. Thanks very much.
Great guys working here. Really stressed as lost sim. They urgently fixed it. Replaced and activated. So technical and so professional I will be back if I need anything further. So happy with the customer service. Thank you so much!
"I visited today Vodafone branch in Watford, where Maria were assigned to help me regarding my enquiry for a contract extension .She was very helpful and polite . Thank you Maria."
"Been thinking of leaving for years and somehow get pulled back into another expensive long contract.I have had enough.  20 years of loyalty not appreciated by Vodafone. Cannot talk to a human. Its a terrible chatbot service which freezes all the time, jumps around.  The rep tells you if you do not reply instantly - chat is over.  Can't tell them it keeps freezing! Because of needing a new phone quickly (end of contract), got reeled back in.  Only to find out AFTERWARDS phone not available (yes I am fuming).Cancelled the agreement.  No confirmation this has actually happened. No emails.  Nothing.Terrible customer service.Going elsewhere where we will be treated with the respect due."
"Dan was amazing, as always, when I come in store. Really helpful and accommodating 😊"
Really lovely personal service from the in person team in shop - thank you
"My experience recently in the Vodafone Portsmouth store was more than exceptional. It’s never been easier to upgrade and being able to talk to someone face to face is great! Thank you for your help. My grandson has helped me with my new phone, as I ran out of time. Thanks again"
"Disgusting money grabbing, miss-selling company, paid off my contract then asked to just do sim only month by month. Signed me up for a 24 month contract without me knowing, won’t let me cancel it without paying a fee.ALL THIS AFTER TAKING 2 MONTHS TO REPEATEDLY FAIL TO INSTALL MY WIFI DO NOT USE EVER"
Maria at the Watford Store was grey she explained everything so clearly and helped clear up any confusion I had. 10/10 experience!!
Brompton Road Vodafone was very helpful! Especially the two lovely ladies that took their time to explain and answer all my questions.
"Experience in store was great, Rob helped Pat to get us a great deal on our hbb and phones"
"So helpful, patient and answered all my questions in a well mannered way"
"Very happy with customer service, very polite , offered us tea and coffee, sat us down and discussed everything in detail.

"Jonny / Jonathan was amazing Professional, patient, knowledgeable and completely understanding and very helpful Sold 2 phones to me and my husband"
Sales advisor was very knowledgeable about the various contracts & what would be best suited to both mine & my mums needs.She was very pleasant & helpful
Vodafone has to be the worst company on the entire planet!!!!!Please don't whatever you do however appealing the deal maybe just don't go with them.I don't want to write down the experience I have had with them as i dont want to give them any more of my time or relive or recollect the experience which is still going on. They are so seriously bad
Was promised a credit onto my bill but still not received it. Billed twice in the same month. Signed up with Vodafone for a cheaper deal and the price has gone up within 3 months. Tried to chat on the app but no luck and then placed in a queue of 50. Tried to view my bill via the app but nothing loads.
Thank you for you support and dealing with me today you have been amazing
Went in phone phone support and to renew one of my lines  the Huddersfield store team were very helpful
"Ben in the shop was extremely helpful in contacting the The Customer Care Team, broadband team and billing team regarding the unfair bill we received. The billing team has eventually confirmed that we won’t be charged for home moving or “early termination“ because Vodafone cannot provide / continue the same fibres broadband service in our new house. We are only requesting for moving but not cancellation and would love to keep the Vodafone fibre plan if we could!"
Advisors were very friendly and knowledgeable on products and services and made great recommendations personal to me! 5 stars!⭐️
I've had a contract with Vodafone since 2021 for £24 and now they increased it to £30. 2 years and they have increased it by 25%. Madness.
Zara was very knowledgable helpful courteous with a good sense of humour - she explained all the options and gave her recommendations
Shax was amazing! Super helpful and sorted out all my problems for me! Pay rise for him he’s so lovely!!
"Awful customer service, impossible to get through to a person on the phone service, always refers you back to their useless webchat or website. Shops are understaffed and queue for hours to get to speak to someone there. Also, they have just ramped my bill up by 14.4% mid-contract."
Happy and helpful staff. Been in a few time in the last month and always helped me with my issues.  😊
Great store saved money I explained about home broadband saving when my contract ends with sky
"The staff were very kind and friendly and welcoming, and had all the information I needed, very happy"
The advisor Mariyam was extremely helpful and patient. I had an issue with my account that other stores dismissed and said to call customer service. She kindly say with me and helped me sort it out. Amazing customer service at Brompton road
Mark was extremely helpful today and very informative and got me the best deal for me
"Vodafone UK are simply terrible in every aspect, but I’m writing this review, because I tried to cancel my last contract I signed with them in the cooling off period (30 days). I was calling them a trying to chat online with them, but it was almost impossible to contact them. I was waiting for hours to talk with someone and at the end I hanged up the call because I didn’t have more time to waste. I managed to contact them after a couple weeks and they canceled my contract and I paid the last bill received by email. When I spoke with them I explained what the situation was and they assured me that everything was done. After a month or so they gave my details to 2 debt collectors asking for £350 m, because I haven’t ended my contract during that 30 days period, but they know I tried and it was only their fault it was not canceled on time.Just to clarify I was paying for sim only, no mobile or any other device.This is what you get from Vodafone after years with them without even one missed or delayed payment.Don’t sign with them - too expensive with very poor cst service.Update: contacted them via twitter as they advised me, but nothing happened. They don’t even reply regarding the problem. The same terrible experience and waste of time and money. Don’t waste your time."
"Great customer service, staff were thorough and honest, and genuinely lovely people to talk to!"
We went in to Upgrade we always have a great experience with Vanessa. She has helped us many times. me and my husband both needed new phones and she helped transfer data.
Brilliant service by Warren at sutton Vodafone phone store
"My wife, who passed away two and a half years ago, keeps getting letters from debt collectors for her Vodafone account which was closed over two years ago, by Vodafone. (Fully paid up)Despite countless attempts, speaking to anyone at Vodafone, other than a robot is impossible. I have tried speaking with Zinc, the debt collectors, but they say they are acting on behalf of Vodafone. They have attempted to transfer me to Vodafone, but I get disconnected every time.I can't rate less than one star, otherwise, I would."
"Friendly, professional service.   Thank you."
Excellent service in the Broadstairs from Gee :)
Tahar is a good salesman help-desk me Witherspoon good deals
"Excellent customer service by the the asst  manager of Vodafone,  Ealing Broadway branch..Patryk. Thank you for your help and advice   Much appreciated  🙏 👍 😊Nivedita Sengupta * Nivea. / Customer."

"Today was a great day at Vodafone we were served by a sales person called Caio who explained everything with great detail, a very pleasant man nothing was too much for Caio will sure ask for him again."
"Professionalism, consideration and kindness in spite of being very busy."
"I managed to do an upgrade and get a new tablet, thank you to the service that Vanessa offered me, she is the best! Muchas gracias 😃"
Fab service from Parnika today in Exeter shop. Great deal for my broadband. Thank you so much Parnika!
Amazing staff who are always on hand to help me upgrade or just general questions so I can get the best service
All the installation is done by Openreach and yet they have no control on them as a sub-contractor. My istallation was planned for 11th April. The date was set 1 month before. Openreach engineer said the line is not live! Then the drama began. They said it may takes up to 5 working days! Today is 17th. 6 days after the contract date and I am still getting same auto-generated text in online chat.  Not a good experinced so far... They promise me tomorrow the line will be activated. Next update will be posted Tomorrow . Either a 1 start or a 3 depend on Openreach!! I sould kept my ISP.**** UPDATE on 18 th APR ************On 18th April they keep delaying So 2* has changed to 1*. They are now saying they CAN NOT Compence me at all.  Thank you!!  1* Company.1* Online chat service. ********************Do not read the folllwing response. its just useless.Update on 25th April.... Still waiting .... Seriously ??
"Absolutely brilliant service from Jemma, always has a smile on her face and really helpful. No more cleaner apps! Well lushhhh!"
Called today with my wife to transfer my contacts and photos from our old phones to the new handsets we picked up Glen was so helpful in the process
"Dan was very helpful in getting me set up with Vodafone. He made things very clear and guided me through the purchasing process. Vodafone has also provided me with a greater phone signal, I am very happy that I switched providers."
"Mark was really Great , help with all questions , made the process faster"
"FINAL UPDATE: I’m putting this at the top, so that’s it’s recognised that I have been updating my experience.Dispute Vodafone blaming DPD for non receipt of the returned cube, if you lock up the tracking number Vodafone sent me in a text on the 17th, it clearly states it was received and signed for on the 11th by “Kolar”.So there you have it. Vodafone received it, but can’t find it, leaving me in limbo and without any refund.To add insult to injury, yesterday I received an email saying I owed Vodafone £79.I responded via the chat link, was passed around and each promised they would get it sorted.  I was about to be passed to another person when I stopped the conversation because I was not willing to waste any more of my time. I informed Vodafone that I had raised a claim through my bank (with supporting evidence), my bank would refund me, claim from Vodafone and it’s up to Vodafone to sort their own mes out. Shocking service and lied too multiple times.  Ordered two dongle services for use away from home.  Was told I could re-route DPD to location I was staying at (1st lie).  DPD would not allow, only Vodafone could do this.  Called next day to cancel.  On chatbot with agent was asked for re-routing address, gave it in writing, told change had been made (2nd lie). Called DPD next day, they advised postcode given to them was not correct and had asked Vodafone on email to contact them.  No contact was made, called Vodafone again (this is now day 3).  Spoke to operative who assured me all my problems were resolved and she had made the changes to the delivery address, so I could “relax” (3rd lie).  Called DPD next day, address not changed.  Called Vodafone (day 4), told that when ordering for the first time you CAN’T re-route!!! However she made the changes and said goods were now re-routed and would get them delivered next day. Day 5 called DPD, was told address changed but where I wanted them delivered not possible so we’re acting on “next best address” available for following week as it was now Easter, but this was not possible as shop was closed !!… called Vodafone.  Told goods would be re-routed back to Vodafone after I asked to cancel everything and refund my money.  It’s been a week and Vodafone have “lost” goods.  My DPD app showed them originally, but then they disappeared (no confirmation of delivery).  It’s been a week and I’m now on the phone again trying to get a refund activated.  You talk to agents around the world, they don’t read your notes, you have to explain continually what has happened.  They tell you you can’t talk to a manager. They tell you something different every time you call. It’s frustrating and makes you angry. I would NEVER recommend them based on their customer service experience.UPDATE……As you can see Vodafone have contacted me but I don’t use Facebook or Twitter…still waiting for my refund.  DPD reference they gave me shows goods were prepared for return to Vodafone April 6th.  It’s already the 21st and still no refund.  Hey Vodafone, why not try emailing me or better still, call me.  As it is I’m having to call you, again.  Operator just told me the refund is not showing, on Monday 17th I was told in the phone call that lasted over an hour (cause they operator couldn’t grasp what had happened) that I would get it in the next 5 days (by Friday), I asked for a text to confirm BUT SHE HUNG UP…so ANOTHER LIE!!! - and now I’m told they have not even cancelled the line!!!…so they want to refund against a bill for charges related to a product I haven’t had and cancelled weeks ago??!!! He’s now calling the warehouse - I’ve been on the phone 20mins already and getting nowhere.  It’s simple, they’ve lost it (it’s obvious) and I’m paying the price for they’re incompetence and lies.Now at 30 mins, so far I’ve been on hold for 3/4 of the call.They are blaming DPD. I’m told they need to now raise an investigation and this will take 5 days!!!  He just said “I can refund you today but it would be wrong”……unbelievable. And he’s just asked me why am I angry, because there’s no reason I should be upset!!!!!"
My experience with Vodafone has been great Dan helped me get the best deal possible when getting Mt sim only deal. Dan has great communication skills and really listened to what I was asking for. I would highly recommend Vodafone to friends and family through Dan.
Very helpful and explained in detail my contract great help
Many Thanks to MARC at the Livingston store for all his help….couldn’t have done it without him. Well mannered & knowledgeable in his job.
"I recently had the pleasure of working with Jamie, and I have to say that I was thoroughly impressed by his professionalism and expertise.Jamie took the time to break down my account and explain everything to me in a clear and concise manner. He was patient, knowledgeable, and went above and beyond to ensure that I fully understood everything about my account.Not only was Jamie able to explain the technical aspects of my account, but he was also able to provide valuable insights and recommendations based on my usage patterns. He was able to identify areas where I could save money and improve my overall experience with Vodafone.I appreciated Jamie's attention to detail and his willingness to answer all of my questions. He was polite, courteous, and made the entire process seamless and stress-free.Overall, I would highly recommend Jamie to anyone in need of a sales consultant at the Vodafone store. His expertise and customer service skills are truly exceptional, and I feel confident that anyone who works with him will be more than satisfied with the experience. Thank you, Jamie, for all of your help!"
Subrata helped me with issues I had on my new phone. Happy with the service in store.
"Vodafone locked me into a 2-year contract which they will not let me leave. However, they have increased the price of the CONTRACT numerous times, which was not the price I signed up for. In the last 18 months they have increased my CONTRACT price by almost 50%!!!! Yet, they won't let me leave unless I pay them the full outstanding contract amount, which doesn't make sense as I'd be giving them my money for no service provided. They also won't offer to lower my bill on par with what they are offering new customers (if you're considering taking their offer, don't join them!!!!! Or you'll fall victim to the same scam as me). I'm now paying outrageous £18.75 per month for a meager 5GB data plan (!!!!!), whereas ANYWHERE ELSE this plan would be around £5 - and Vodafone pretends that they have to UP MY PRICE mid-contract by 14.5% just now, from £16.39 (which was my current price after 2x price increases already) to £18.75!! I am so disgusted it's beyond belief. Energy companies and mortgage providers can't up your price mid-contract, so why are these thiefing telephone companies allowed to??? I will not be giving them my money for no service, but I swear I will shout from the rooftops to warn people not to sign up for a contract with these cheating robbing b******* and I will never ever give them any of my money. DO NOT USE THEM!!!"
Amazing customer service. Everyone was so polite and easy to deal with
Siobhan was really helpful when I was choosing my new phone in store. I had no idea what to get but she was knowledgeable and friendly throughout & made my decision easy!! Thank you again! I will be back when this contract runs out too 😊
Great service! Would definitely recommend!
Spoke to the adviser Kaiser in the Reading Oracle Vodafone store who was so extemefully polite and really helpful in helping me understanding my contract. Will definitely be back to see him in person in the near future for my contract renewal. Thanks for help!
"The worst company I've ever had the misfortune of dealing with. Internet was Installed on 28/03/23 and didn't work, had to call them up multiple times and deal with unhelpful advisors and needless to say, three weeks later I still have no internet.I've finally given up and decided to leave and they're not only telling me that I won't be entitled to any compensation for the three weeks that I've been left without internet and the poor service I've received but that I will have to pay a fee to leave. Absolute joke of a company."
"Thank you waseem at Vodafone LLandudno. For helping me and sorting everything out for me . Waseem is very informative and knowledgeable. If in the future I need help , I’d definitely be going back to LLandudno Vodafone for any help. Thanks to all the staff there . 🫡"
"I have been with Vodafone broadband since 2020. Initially it was sold as £22 per month which I thought was quite good. But it has continued to rise year after year to £33. I thought this latest increase was taking the mick so I discussed with live chat. Apparently my contract states they can increase my contract every April by 13.8 percent. I would have never agreed to that so they have either conned me into a ridiculous contract by adding that in small print somewhere? Or they have just added it in. I read contracts very carefully so I assume the later. Didn’t even try and help me change contracts or try to lower the bill. Avoid at all costs this company as they are nothing but thieves. 🤬Update- I received an email due to the one star from a so called senior management to arrange best time to call to discuss. Guess what they haven’t bothered? Too late now I’ve just changed to Zen broadband, I will tell everyone to avoid these jokers like the plague. Don’t you dare even try to take anymore money off me when I go."
"Steve and his  team in the Poole store were incredibly helpful at sorting out a replacement sim quickly for me, friendly and professional."
"Went into kendal store to upgrade as the Vodafone app was not that easy for a non-tech. I was super impressed with Staff member who gave me a lot of his time and seemed knowledgeable in his field. I opted for trade in.  I left both phones for all data to be transferred.  All seemed ok and i had no reason to doubt there was anything amiss.   I left the store very happy with the service i received. HOWEVER I arrived home and nothing would work - no txts, no signal, not able to download some apps!   When we tried to phone my number - went straight to v/mail. Eventually i realised i had NO SIM in the new phone as it had been left in my old phone which we traded in. The very week I needed to have a phone and be contactable I had no phone. I had to then go on Vodafone chat to order a new SIM card and have to do all the effort of keeping my own number!    Couldn’t have happened at a worse time. Couldn’t get back to store for a few days due to working Shop had closed before I realised. Shop was busy and only 2 staff members. Could have been because of the staff being stretched but really problematic for me."
"Incredibly friendly and helpful, Abi, a team member, was very helpful and a pleasure to speak to. I would recommend the store and will definitely be returning in the future."
"Customer service is absolutely appalling. Either they don’t answer the phone or they leave you waiting for up to an hour on web chat before responding and then when you do get through to someone, you have to type some form of response every 2 minutes to “not lose the chat”. EVERY TIME I try to talk to someone about an issue, this message appears - “There’s a problem connecting with an advisor. Please wait while your chat is transferred to another advisor!”Last week, one person told me they had resolved my plan issue but a week later it is still not resolved and again today, no one will help or rectify the problem!Never again will I use Vodafone’s service!"
"Great service, really informative and help me with everything I needed."
"Such a fu**ing terrible customer service! 🤮😡😤 Totally useless good for nothing. 1 h wasted from my life waited for them to help me... But they don't have any interest to do something for me.Heyyyyyy, employ someone who is capable to know to solve a problem and TEACH them how to speak with people! Shame on you!!! Why do you think the reviews are so bad 🤮🤢... Learn to RESPECT ( if you heard about this word) customers! 🤬😡🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬"
Purchased a new phone from St albans Store. Great experiance. Staff were professional. Nice store very clean and upto date. Top attendants to point out Ahmer and Mutahara - very courteous and knowledgeable - attached a great Sim only deal to suit my needs in the UK and abroad - Highly recommend to see them.
Beth is the greatest 🤩 very attentive and friendly. We will come back again for the purchase. I will bring Caffeine for the win 🤣😂🤣😂
Broadband seems to be ok been online with Vodafone since December last year very few outages BUT the Vodafone router is absolutely rubbish we had to buy an extender to reach all our house our previous Talktalk router was fine.Edit 17/4/23 No point in me reaching out as you put it you won't do anything about it I have tried all I was told I would have to upgrade which I don't have the money to do
"Popped in to Vodafone to charge my phone because I couldnt use my Apple Pay :( the lovely gentleman sorted me out and I even got a discount on my broadband whilst I waiting. Happy all round - would definitely recommend, great customer service"
"Although it was very busy when I arrived in the shop and had to wait a little while, I was kept informed and the young man who greeted me handed me over to the relevant skilled technician. He was called Anthony and knew exactly what to do, was kind and knowledgeable and went above and beyond. He retrieved all my data and apps, and I could not be more grateful. I was anxious as I had dropped my phone in water and the screen wouldn't work, but he knew exactly what to do. Excellent service and a very happy customer 🙂"
"Brilliant friendly staff, helped with my question and couldn't be more helpful"
Professional and helpful and gave me a suitable deal at a price I was happy with
Ryan was absolutely fabulous today with my initial query regarding upgrading my phone today . Went out of his way to go get me a phone to hold unlike the previous shop I asked . Explained all the plans and actually saved me money . His customer service skills were excellent and so I felt happy to upgrade there and then . Thank you Ryan
Nurul is just amazing vodafone need more individuals like Nurul khan I will stay with vodafone through Nurul Khan service. The whole barkingside team are really amazing Jake anu jaffa all need pay rise.
I had an amazing experience today with Josh. He is an exceptional customer service staff. I actually went in to make an enquiry and ended up getting a phone contract. He is an amazing staff and he acknowledged every customer that came into the shop. His type of customer service is rare. He is an asset to your organization.
"Very helpfull friendly service from Ryan today, helped my father and went the extra mile to spend extra time to help as he is hard of hearing."
Brilliant service.  Rob was great thanks so much.
Great service from rob today in store for my upgrade
"Excellent customer service from Joe today at the Durham branch.5/5So helpful and polite, really went the extra mile and help me sort my phone out.Was lovely with my little boy.Joe your an asset to the team. Huge congratulations in your promotion.Many thanks for your time,really appreciate it 😊"
"I had just the most exceptional service from Kai and his colleague. My phone had just randomly stopped working and as someone who lives alone and needs their phone for work, i was a little stressed about having no device. They sorted me out with a new phone in no time and showed me how to switch all my apps over within an hour! Just exceptional. So grateful for this amazing service. They were super friendly and beyond helpful."
I have to say today was one of the greatest experiences going to a Vodafone store because Normally I don’t feel as welcomed as I felt today on Vodafone white rose shopping. Thank you Shakunt and Richard (store Manager) for all support and effort to help me with the request I had.
"Total joke of a company!Joining this lot was hard enough. Ordered full fibre broadband and nothing happened! They had no record of the order!  My entire village was kitted out with brand new fibre to the premises infrastructure so finally got there and got my 100mb broadband which worked fine, so decided to upgrade to the higher speed 500mb package, and here is where it started!  Only getting 150mb!  Multiple speed tests from a Ethernet connected device and different speed testing platforms  including BT Wholesales own one throwing back same results.  Technical support said the router wasn’t updated and they would do it and all would be fine with in 2 hours.  It wasn’t, shocker! So L2 support are now  ‘looking into it’. Had had enough by this this point so sent a letter of complaint to the ceos office and not long after I got a call from a very condescending snide member of staff who spoke to me like I was stupid and was asking me what sort of cables I’m using!  I have software that monitors the connections in my house and they all all well above 150mb, above 500 infact!  When I agreed to the new speed, i was entered into a new contract for 24 months and along with that comes a 14 day cooling off period and Vodafone will not honour that and allow me to leave!  They will only offer to downgrade me back to the 100mb plan which is absolutely pointless as I wanted the higher plan for a reason. Nor will they reduce my monthly payment or even credit my bill until their useless support team fix my connection so we are now in deadlock or I can pay over £100 to leave for a service I’m not even getting! I will be taking this to Cisas and making sure that I tell all of my friends to bin this company off as soon as they can and will help them find better deals elsewhere for their broadband and mobile.  All I want is the service I’m paying for, and so now I’ve got to wait 28 days for them to not fix the fault and then I can leave and leave I shall! I was actually warned by a friend and former customer not to get involved with their broadband as I just wish to God I’d listened!  I also found out that because I am only a broadband customer and I’m not with them for mobile, I don’t have access to the veryme rewards scheme so I take from that I’m not important to them as a customer as mobile customers are.  My one saving grace is that I glad I moved to 02 for my Mobile and not Vodafone when the time came!"
Saved me money - always a great experience.
Chrissy was a great help for us getting our upgrades she explained everything and was very friendly and chatty would highly recommend coming in store
left with bad  customer service left in the lurch  Results for “I bought a mobile nothing but trouble with it.I bought it during sale in NOVEMBER 2022 I was on pay as you go Nothing but problems trying to transfer my account over I WENT BACK TO THE shop backwards and forwards telephoned the sales department and customer services trying to get my money back the staff was were sales people go to another network”
Great experience Ryan was very helpful and got my new phone straight away to take home
Very helpful staff up to date tech if you want a new phone would recommend you go and see Anton
Had my phone upgraded early. Was well supported changing phones and staff were patient in taking the time to change over during the upgrade as well as sending my old device off to sell. Experience was great.
Bam was fantastic. 100% confidence with him. Got me a deal that suited my needs.
Really helpful and Genuine guidance by their employee. Please do visit once.
Excellent service from advisors from the St albans store. Honest and very patient to all our questions. Very cheerful and professional bunch!!
"Really helpful staff, Harry got me the phone I wanted for the best deal."
"The whole experience in the meadowhall store was amazing from start to finish. I was greeted by a young guy called Cal, who was very knowledgeable and answered all my questions. He was very cheery and smiled the whole way through the transaction. He looked how he could save me money by moving other numbers and my Internet to Vodafone which I will definitely be doing when they are out of contract. Well done Cal and thank you."
"Ben was a great help, could not ot done I without  him.  Fist rate."
Farhan was extremely freindly and helpful with getting my sim card working again. Also he went above and beyond to get my a fantastic new deal as my contract was ending. I would 100% recommend Vodafone to a freind. Thank you
"Adam the store manager was very helpful and patient into getting us the best deal, great advice, highly recommend vodafone"
"I got a new sim only deal today with kieran in vodaphone horsham. What a pleasure to deal with. Polite, efficient, and knew his stuff. Whole process took leas than 15 minutes! Brilliant. Well done kieran."
Superb swift service with Matt in the Truro vodaphone shop
"I came into store to see if I could get a new contract in my name but keep my old number, the advisor Drew was very helpful understanding patient and very knowledgeable, he made me feel at ease and I’m happy with all the help he gave me, his a great credit to Vodafone team and I will continue to come back and see him"
"As long as I remember this has been the best customer service I ever had. Very attentive, kindly patient and given us options to choose and be comfortable with. Pleased to give a shout out to Shakunt, from Whiterose Vodafone."
tyannna was really helpful and very friendly!
Assistant manager Taj was very helpful! Excellent customer service
"Excellent service from Rushi, great help with my data transfer, all sorted."
"Great service from a friendly, helpful guy. We were provided with great support and got a much  better deal  than we had been quoted. Thank you"
I went into Vodafone shopTo check how much I might be charged in Crete.  Michal was extremely helpful and identified I could be on a different plan which he then swapped me to
GREAT STAFF WHO WERE WARM TO TALK TO. THE PROCESS OF GETTING THE NEW PHONE FOR MY DAUGHTER WAS A GREAT EXPERIENCE .
Kerry was so helpful. I hope that she is at the shop next time .Nothing was too much trouble. She is a star.
nice shop with plenty of choice. I will return
Phone and sim contract came to an end and I explained that I want a sim only plan for around 10gb but the best he said he could do is 20gb for £15. I explained that the sim only deals are £10 for 20gb but he said as an existing customer my options are to pay more if I want to keep my number or take out an additional sim for that deal but I can't transfer my number...So if I want to keep my number I have to stay with vodaphone and pay more or transfer my number to another provider which I am.Voxi uses their network and I'll get £30gb for £10.Makes no sense they treat their customers like that.Never again.
"I went to upgrade my contract and was served by a lovely lady called Emma who was very helpful and talked me through different phones and contracts I could have, Emma was very thorough and made the whole process as easy as possible"
the staff were very good and they have me a good deal on my sim upgrade
Macauley was really helpful in helping me find a sim contract that suited my needs! And saving me money in this current financial crisis
BenA was super efficient and very friendly. I achieved what I wanted in-store.
I always go to Leeds store if I need any help or to buy. Staff is amazing. Advisor named Richa placed my order. She is very kind and helpful.
Went there to get a new sim card for my Nokia. Good guys inside!
"Great sales advisor Chris found the  best plan to suit my needs. Friendly,Efficient and knowledgeable. Fantastic service. Would recommend."
"Been with them for a year, data never works , they have increased prices by £8.50!! Surely that isn’t right, when called to enquire they said it’s the yearly thing they do , surely that’s only like £2/3£ increase, very unhelpful customer service ."
"These guys are incompetent at best and capricious at worst. I've told then repeatedly to cancel my service as I left England for South America in October 2022. Supplied screenshots of my mobile number while there and the purchase receipt, showed them my ID in the form of a passport and driver's licence. Told them I haven't used the service, no data nothing since October 2022 and to cancel ASAP. Recently got charged 23 pounds long after requesting cancellation."
"Carly of Llandudno Vodafone was excellent with what we needed.Very welcoming,knowledgeable and a credit to the company."
"Just got my new phone today, have to say Jason was just the most patient guy ever while I went back and forth trying to decide over and over re the Samsung S23 v Pixel Pro, genuinely he was so helpful and spent so much time helping us.  If Carlsberg made phone salesmen it would be Jason from the Braehead store!"
"Unable yo use landline for 3 weeks, line unclear, and phone keeps ringing  intermittently  night and day.Engineer fixed line, worked for a day, contacted Vodafone, said line is ok, ned to buy new phone.Bought phone, problem persists, called today, informed that there is issue with open reach in my area, when pressed when this issue began told 24 hours ago. Currently no service.Disgusting service, will be cancelling contract"
I was once again served by the assistant store manager Syed at Brent Cross London. I also saw Syed a year ago for my home broadband service. I thought I would come back for a sim only deal. He gave me a fantastic offer which I could not refuse last year and again this year. 150gb for £13 per month? No other network could offer me this deal!Thank you Syed you deserve a pay rise for your amazing customer service and dedication !
I recently upgraded my phone at the Vodafone Poole store and was very impressed with the service provided to me. The staff there are friendly and welcoming and nothing is too much trouble. Customer service is excellent and special thanks to Steven for sorting my upgrade and to Hayley for helping with the process too. Both really great and knowledgeable. I’ll be back to the Poole store next time I need an upgrade.  Thanks again!
"I had a great experience with zara in Vodafone, she was great and more than happy to help with any questions I had and made me feel comfortable, she went through everything that I needed 2 know and more 👍 would defo recommend 🙂."
"Needed help renewing a contract, Claire from Vodafone Livingston was extremely helpful, went above and beyond, I even took out a broadband contract! Who even knew that Vodafone did broadband?? I'm very happy with the service and I'd definitely recommend Vodafone in the future."
Richard was extremely helpful assisting us upgrade all our phones and saving us a fair amount of money each month going forward. He spent a lot of time going through and explaining everything to make sure we got the right deal. Very happy.
"Been with Vodafone for years and always used the store in Blackpool, the staff are friendly, knowledgeable and happy to help with any issues. didn’t feel rushed or ripped off.  Gillian was a great help with transferring my data from my old phone to my new phone. Thanks guys!"
"So I had taken out a contract at the beginning of this year from Vodafone at a agreed amount of 35£ without any discount and due to CPI increase I've had a huge increase so I rang Vodafone to understand more, I had an adviser out me on hold for over 40 mins and a manager who was lying to me they did not even attempt to help me Being rude is a understatement speaking to me trying to intimate me and saying I had a discount on my package which I've never been aware of If anyone from Vodafone management team would like more information please get in touch Ola a manager from customer care was speaking to me like I was low with no respect not listening is this how Vodafone works"
Spoke to a nice man and really helped me fix my issue of transferring accounts over. Super helpful but thats were the good ends.The Data feature is useless never works.Pay for unlimited data and never can get a connection or a good one
"What a complete joke of a company.No contact email, chat bot won't send a text to registered mobile, advisors constantly busy, held in an empty abyss wondering if your still connected or have been cut off and having to pay for the nothingness aswel.Just want to cancel contract pay money owed including early termination fee and get on with my life.Never known anything like it, horrendous customer service.I do not have a Facebook or Twitter account, please don't ask me to contact you via these social media platforms."
"They’re absolutely horrible. They kept renewing my 30-day contact even though I asked them not to. To cancel, I had to eat 35 minutes and asked 10 different questions twice."
Malina has been such a great help with my upgrade today. She is such a valued member of your team
"Malina was really helpful and made sure I got a good deal. :) Hello, the Gmail id you entered is incorrect; I am not able to login to my Vodafone account"
"Excellent service from Liam, thorough explanation of the services available."
My contract ended and I wanted to switch to PAYG  I was on chat for an hour with someone who couldn't help only was asking stupid questions and was giving me some offerts after all he said I have to call to them so I did .then they transfer me from one advisor to another for another hour and finally  she send me a link which told me if I would like to switch from contract to PAYG i have to call to them 😂😂😂😤this is wrong absolutely shocking..  bye bye vodaphone hello O2 ..and fu*** you TOBI chat 🫡
"The sales team were well inform about their product, and very helpful in clearing my problems with log in. That l have decided to stay with Vodafone and purchased a Board Band."
One more upgrade as it was this time of the year. Natasha provided a great service and explained all features of the new plans. Will definitely come back for my home broadband upgrade.
Very helpful and knowledgeable of our needs and requirements. Friendly and patient which is unusual to find in service roles at the moment.
Worst Customer service :Called their customer service to discuss the outage happened on 10th April and they keep on keeping me on hold and playing passing the parcel from one team to another . After sometime the call gets disconnected by itself without any resolution. At the start of the call they say they will come back to us but no one does. Won't recommend.
Oil is the best and most attentive member of staff. Always feel happy with all help and advice
Horsham team was very helpful and prompt hope they will keep the promise and meet up with deadlines than the crawaly team
Patrick helped me soo much with getting me a new phone and sorting out my payment for my watch.
My SIM contract was ending and Becky was very helpful getting me set up on a new contract that had more data and let me keep getting Spotify.  Then I had trouble logging back into Spotify and Becky was very helpful again helping me figure out how to fix it.
"Great help from Marc! Chatty and east to talk too, thank you :)"
Very friendly and helpful with lots of knowledge on the phone options

I went into the Watford store and spoke to Priya she gave me some very good advice on home broadband and on more information on a new mobile plan. Great customer service
I came into store as my father had an issue with his phone that I couldn't fix.  Stuart was extremely helpful and friendly and managed to fix the problem very quickly! I definitely will be coming to the Ards store for my upgrades from now on.

I upgraded to a New Samsung S23 Ultra 256GB. Both advisors took great care and time with me over the past 2 weeks - aided me in making a well informed decision. Demoed both the S23 plus and the S23 Ultra - helped me trial cameras on both phones. The Ultra edition was superb. Advisors were very patient and extremely helpful. Explanations were made from start to end of sale. I am very happy with my purchase at the St Albans store. Everyone please see these two advisors!!

"Didn’t even email or send post to notify contract ending just increased the DD which I cancelled and now I can’t even get through to Customer Service without paying the outstanding £30 balance which is what I’m calling to discuss. I waived the fact that they increased from £17 to £23 mid-contract (for a service I’m literally not using at all but wanted to keep the number active and went for a media package so that it included my Spotify subscription making it worth it for me). Now I wanted to raise a complaint and have some compensation before clearing the balance, but can’t get through to them without clearing the balance first!!! Ridiculous.Edit: Your reply directs only to resolve things via Facebook or Twitter which I don’t use. Great to know you only care about your social media image rather than your actual relationship with customers. Been a customer for 11 years. 11 YEARS, even paid your ridiculous data overcharges throughout 2017 when I was living with no WiFi for some time and your bills were over £200/month when I was on a low income of barely £900/month (full time employment just on minimum wage). Just a horrid company, but your signal coverage saves you c**ts."
Great service and advice from joaoStevenage
"I was attended to by the manager there 'Agatha' a very helpful and patient lady, a credit to Vodafone, once again I was very impressed by her professionalism and patience"
I got totally locked out of my account and my phone wouldn't work due to it being damaged and Kerry in the Northwich branch really helped out to reconfigure my new phone and regain access to my Google account and banking apps etc due to me not being able to remember my pass codes......her assistance was invaluable as I could not use my Debit card to get cash or even pay for anything.......Vodaphone Northwich 100% recommended
Went to another store not great came in and spoke to Liam and Tom who gave me what I wanted. Excellent service
"Matt, the store manager in the Preston, Fishergate store was absolutely brilliant. He explained what my choices were and I actually left the store with exactly what I wanted which isn't always that easy these days! Cheers Matt!"
"Very helpful, thanks Suki!"
Great Customer Service Tom and Naz were helpful and effecient
Rey efficient polite and speedy service thank you
Newbury store Cameron and Charlie great friendly service
Great help in the shop today couldn't fault the service we had!
Jake @ Vodafone barry was very helpful and polite lovely young man
Mutahara at the Vodafone St Albans branch is exceptional! Helped me with a new contract for my son.
"Vodafone Truro, great service,  wry friendly."
Aadil was amazing today; helped me out no end and I really appreciated it. Would recommend 100%
Very impressed...5 star service from Marnie...thank you
"i came into the corby store with a query about my broadband, tony was an amazing help and got me through to the correct people. i feel very satisfied with the advice he gave me and would 100% recommend this store!!"
"Sam the store manager at Vodafone provided an excellent service. I was impressed with Sam’s knowledge and I believe he went out of his way to assist me with my query. Great store, Sam is a big asset for Vodafone."
"I took my 5 month old phone I had purchased from Vodafone into Gloucester store with a fault and was advised 5-10 for completion.   My phone was kept at the store for 6 days before being sent to the repair department, I was then informed it was unrepairable and a like new alternative would be sent.   The replacement has still not been sent out and I have been informed that I will have wait nearly another week before the matter is resolved.    After finishing my call with customer services Vodafone have bombarded my old phone with repetitive text messages all saying the same thing.    I would not suggest anyone get a phone from Vodafone. Pointless reply from Vodafone, customer service agent has already told me there is nothing else can be done and I will just have to put up it."
"Dan was incredibly helpful, saved me money and was charming, Many thanks"
"William from Hemel Hempstead, very helpful  great customer service. Phone all sorted thank you"
I went in a few days ago with a problem regarding a faulty sim and issues connecting to the Network. I was assisted by a member of the team called Chris Rilo. He was extremely helpful and went above and beyond to sort out all my issues. He then proceeded to sort me out with an early upgrade and an incredible deal. For once I felt as if I wasn't being bent over a barrel.
"Great store, lovely staff, was helped by a young man called Chris that helped me figure out what plan I needed."
"Warmly greeted at the store and advised a 15 minute wait, pleasant and helpful staff especially Hayley who sourced exactly right new contract that my husband was seeking at a very good price. We left as very happy and satisfied customers having received excellent service."
Luke was great when I went in to renew my phone contract - really appreciate it.
Matthew at Rushmerr explained everything well. Polite and didnt rush me. Excellent customer service!
Dan was very helpful informative a relaxed experience
"Sam John was, amazing. Upgrade my sim was helpfuk"
Staff were very helpful and fully explained my options regarding my concerns of upgrading early. Very informative information received from them that allowed me to make the best choice suitable for me.
"Liars liars liarsI am a business costumer recently took contract with vodafone. Firstly, it is very hard to get hold of them.I signed the contract and they confirmed the installation on 14th this month over.the phone, I clearly mentioned, I want the installation to be completed on the 14th, they agreed and said the kit will be delivered on 11th, after 5 mins I received an email that your kit will be delivered on 21st, i called them back straight away but no answer. Two days ago I received an email that the installation is booked on 26th. I got shocked thinking the way they made me sign the contract with them as I told them I need the internet for my business as soon as possible. This company will do anything to sign the contract with you and once you are bond with them, you can't get away. I am just waiting for another company to sort my broadband for my business. Totally disappointed with Vodafone."
It was wonderfull really  helpful  great shop I would highly  recommend  this shop it's the best !!! All the staff are very helpful
"STAY AWAY! Took out an iphone and sim plan with vodafone a year and a half ago. No problem with the iphone plan but the sim started out at £15 a month and is now £29 a month (this is on the same sim contract) . They did not give me with 30 days notice for the price increase. The signal has been awful since the start. They do everything to make it hard to get out of. Customer service is very poor also, I waited 45 minutes to be connected to an advisor using the online chat then was transferred to different departments twice, then it threw me off the chat system."
"I realise that it is early days of my becoming a new 'Vodaphone' internet customer, but at the moment all I can say is, ""WoW!!!"" I never thought I would ever change providers, and after 18 years with our previous provider we felt thet we had to say 'Goodbye' to them because they were putting up their prices. Moving to Vodaphone was so easy; with no hassle and the engineers were so polite and friendly. Not only is our broadband cheaper, but it is so much faster and EVERYTHING is going wonderfully, so thank you Vodaphone I am enjoying being a new customer."
Took Vodafone Internet in October 2022 and I've had speeds of between 800-1000 constantly with no problem. I'm in Coventry and we have superfast fibre which in my experience has kicked the ass of Virgin fibre and I'm so glad I switched. Although I'm having to use the ombudsman as Virgin have continued to bill me after the service was cancelled.
Fadil dealt with my upgrade he was very polite and helpful.
"I use my vodafone sim card in 83 countries like in EnglandI have used all kinds of sims, there is no better than vodafone.  vodafone is the biggest in terms of both customer service and service provider.  thanks"
"Ahmer and Mutahara at St Albans what a pair. If you want to open a Mobile phone Account - These two inviduals are the best in the business - Sat me down, understood all my needs and produced all the best options - They put me and my requirements above everything, tailor made my plan and im am extremely happy - so caring and trustworthy!! Highly recommend the St Albans Vodafone."
Johnny was fantastic so patient and kind and totally full of knowledge about the phone and Vodafone. What a wonderful member of staff you have. The Widnes store is the best.
"We have been using Vodafone Leamington Spa for along time now. Surj and his staff are always friendly and very helpful, we wouldn’t go anywhere else."
"My father is nearly ninety with memory problems, he has lost his phone. He will not get another one because he struggles to remember how to use it.  He is on contract for another year. I asked to talk to the Vulnerability Department (CAS) and they refused to talk to me. I asked to talk to the Complaints Department and they refused. I asked 3 times to talk to a manager and was refused each time having to accept a call back the day after. Is this how Vodafone treat their vulnerable customers! It's disgraceful, I hope that when I do eventually get to talk to a manager they have more understanding and empathy."
"Went in for some tech support and queries. Hamish was excellent and provided quality customer service, I would highly recommend this establishment."
I called 2-3 weeks ago to inform them of my change of address and to disconnect at ol property and connect at newThe house move got put back a week so I rang and was told everything had been altered to the 19th April My broadband has now been disconnected and Vodafone can not reconnect me.Through no fault of my own I am now without broadband when I spoke to them they offered me a free sim card for my phoneThey have obviously turned my connection off so why can't they just turn it back on again.I think this is appalling customer service and I won't be recommending Vodafone to anyoneI can't contact tou on Facebook or Twitter I'm not on any social media an engineer didn't come and turn my broadband off so why would he need to come to turn it back onThis is all Vodafones fault but feels like it's my fault and I'm being charged for a service I'm not gettingAN ABSOLUTE JOKE
"Cancelled contract in December. They then refused to email me a final bill. After having to call in 3 times to get clarity on this they advsied I was owed a refund. Then 3 months later they apply a default on my credit file due to them giving me too much of a refund. Raised numerous complaints asked to speak to managers. Everytime no update, no call back and no explanation."
"Be prepared to waste several hours talking to chatbots and automatons even to complete the simplest chore.   Absolutely shocking customer service.  You cannot even submit a complaint about how terrible they are without going through the same rigmarole again.UPDATEI got a much faster response to my Trustpilot review than I did from actually trying to 'reach out to them' as they have suggested I do again.   The irony!  As per many other reviews about being unable to make contact with Vodafone, their solution is to make contact with them!"
"ONE STAR IS TOO MANYVodafone do not care about their customersTraining appears to be nil.Today I have had correspondence with 6 different people, not one could help and Apple from the CEO office could not care less, totally disinterested, she did indicate they were inundated with complaints, I wonder why???? As soon as I am out of contract I am off, although that won't bother Vodafone, I will take my business where I will be valued"
"I have just received the worst customer service of my life from this company. I have used them for over 10 years. Recently, I changed address and ordered a new phone as I was at the end of my existing contract. I ordered premium delivery and waited in. The phone didn't arrive. When I looked up the delivery note it said that the order had been cancelled. I didn't have any warning of this.I phoned up to ask why and they said it was a credit issue. For context my Experian credit rating is over 950, I've just secured a new mortgage for a sum slightly less than 6 digits and for over 10 years I've never missed a payment to them. I knew there was some kind of system error because I could prove that my credit was fine, especially given the recent loan from the Bank ( who given the sums involved were likely to have carried out a higher level of diligence than a mobile phone company). I then made multiple calls ( all of which involved queing for 20 minutes or  more). I got bounced from one person to the next. Each person sounded like they wanted to help and so I persevered. However, 5 hours later (I wish I was exaggerating) I was not able to solve the issue, despite offering to send them my credit report. Given that I can prove that there's no issue with my credit, it seems obvious to me that there is a system error, which is very likely to be impacting other people as well. However, rather than looking into this and checking, they seem quite happy to allow an issue to fester and effect, I assume, a ,lot of other people.If you want to avoid the fury of dealing with appallingly bad customer service, avoid this company like the plague. They are absolutely terrible and  deserve to fail as a company."
Praise was very helpful and informative. Helped with my questions.
I have been trying to cancel a Vodafone contract since February. It is impossible to speak to anyone. Only option is to spend hours in a ‘chat’ which involved a nonsensical exchange with a chat bot and then two hours trying to get them to cancel the contract. Did not succeed. I would recommend avoiding this company. It’s customer service is awful.
Helpful and patient guiding me through the contract
A few issues which the guys sorted really quickly and efficently. Great professional service from start t9 finish
"Every year they are increasing my broadband monthly bill but still offer ""a trap"" for new joiners for a way cheaper price. Once my contract end, will never return to them!"
"Kimberley was really helpful, solved all the problems I was having with my upgrade very efficiently :)"
zara from the uxbridge branch was very helpful and friendly. everything was sorted very quickly
"Fantastic team here, always able to help me with any problems I have be it with my sim card or my phone itself. 100% recommend this store if you want to support Vodafone and have a friendly conversation about deals."
"I needed to change my contract which was at the end of it's term and had been put onto a more expensive contract. The lady manning the customer service in the shop was very helpful and has got me a SIM only deal for £16,50 for 6 months while I am looking for an upgrade phone. She was polite and very helpful and had completed everything in the Ross on Wye shop for me"
"Should be called a scammer instead of a company. Being scammed to enter a contract of 2 years with them with little/no internet signal. Much higher charge than other suppliers just for call and texting. That’s why they tried to fixed their horrible contracts with 6ms half price. It’s just horrible afterwards.Pls for the benefit of your wallet, stay away from them. Will move in a heartbeat once my contract ended."
"Praise has good interpersonal skills, very patient and he made me feel valued, respected and not just a number. I will definitely recommend Vodafone to my colleagues if this kind service continues. For the first time I can say I received excellent service"
"Amazing service, patient got our business set up so quickly. Even close to closing, Bana, Emilis stayed with us to sort our issues and gave us advice for the best products for our needs. Both deserve a raise! Came back in next day and Raul and Bana helped us and we are now ready to go with our business. Thank you"
"The charming one woman who looked after me this morning was helpful, patient and knowledgeable. Thank you!"
"I found the staff to be extremely helpful, and I dealt with Olly for the second time for a successful purchase at the Newmarket branch."
"What do I need to do to get Vodafone to communicate with me.  I've asked for a callback, I've put in a complaint.  Nothing. The link to monitor complaint doesn't work.  I was due to have business broadband installed 14th March, then 5th April and still nothing.  I don't know what's going on or what to do to get information.   I was promised a dongle if it dragged on but told it was going to happen soon."
Absolutely brilliant customer service experience from an expert sales advisor
"Amazing customer service. Both colleagues I spoke to were extremely informative and helpful, and very patient too."
"Sahill was an amazing help at the exeter branch. Very knowledgeable, great customer services."
Very helpful Very pleased I met Sam He is a tremendous asset to your company
Once again Vodafone tell me that they will send me link to access a different tariff again they failed. Explain this to be the phone I am writing this review on has no sim but is working fine. My New phone tells me no Internet. Had to but mobile data on. Why. I am still missing calls. Or getting cut off or not being heard or a unturned radio sound. This is the second  sim and phone number in 3 months I can keep changing it. I want to leave with no learly leavers fee being added. I have done as you have asked it hasn't solved the problems. Aslo no adapter of landline in box.. Another letter on route.
"Monthly mobile bill just went up by 14.4%, therefore 1 star. ""Everyone else does it"" is no excuse for ripping off loyal customers. I assume all of your staff are getting a 14.4% pay rise."
I was at Bluewater Vodafone and I was helped by Sonya. Sonya was awesome. She walked me through prices of my upgrade and managed to get the phone I wanted before I left. Was a very happy customer when leaving.

"Lottie was very efficient knowledgeable and personable. Excellent service, thank you."
Andreea is very efficient and very helpful.
This Company are just an utter disgrace and I don’t have one good word for them.On the 6 April we upgraded and had Full Fibre installed. OpenReach completed their work by 11.00 and the engineer spent the next 2hrs trying to connect to Vodafone’s router. He left leaving us with no internet and was very apologetic but said Vodafone had to do something their end. The next 4hrs was spent on their chat line eventually being assured it would be on by midnight. Next day more time wasted on the chat line to be told it could take up to 48hrs. It eventually came on after 36hrs.Been running a week now and although we have paid for 200mps we are only getting 86/87mps and we are supposed to be guaranteed a minimum of 100mps. Back on the chat line for over an hour to be told by some idiot from God knows where that he had carried out tests and our router was getting 200mps. It was if he was calling me a liar because we are still only getting 86/88mps which is little more than we were getting with our cabled service.Customer Service is completely nonexistent and the chat service keep transferring you to what they say is another departing and you spend hours on there and achieve absolutely nothing.If they reply at all on here it will be to tell me to ring a certain number rather than deal with the issues. They can tell who I am from the account number which is not in public view.You will see the response just as I predicted. They have the account number so they can check the history. If they think I’m going to go back to their utterly useless chat service again they can forget it. If you visit a shop for say a mobile phone it might be OK but DO NOT PURCHASE VODAFONE BROADBAND.
Nice assistant very friendly and good serviceIn Exeter Devon
"Isha, our customer service representative, is who made our experience so wonderful.She clearly has a passion for her work and wonderful customer service skills.Keep up the great work.Sincerely, John Reilly"
"Nick at the Vodafone shop in Kings Lynn was friendly, efficient & very good at his job. Nick resolved a very difficult problem for me in a confident & knowledgeable way. I would highly recommend him & the service he provided"
"Kyle is the Vodafone shop in Caerphilly branch was really helpful, I changes my plan to a sim only and saves me £40 a month"
Kyle  and Scott at the store very helpful and great advice to help us with our purchase
"We met Richard, who we had met in January when I upgraded my mobile phone at the Bury st Edmunds store. Richard was patient, friendly,  polite, listened to my problems and gave the information I required in an easy manner. My thanks to Richard"
My phone was stolen please return it or give me a pov
Great service from Paul and the team in Banbury. My broadband now works and has never been faster
"The login procedure in the app is a joke - sends a code which isn't long enough for the login requirements 🤷🏻‍♀️.The chat bot is worse than useless, then when I was put through to an advisor, I was number ONE HUNDRED AND TEN in the queue. I think with the prices you're charging Vodafone, you could afford to hire a few more customer service representatives.Appalling. Have previously had their TV/broadband and that was useless too.It must take some commitment to be this awful, they must really work at it!Will be leaving this useless company as soon as possible.Update: I've tried to log in using the links supplied in the reply below. Even more useless!!!!Utter shambles. How a technology company has such inept customer service and ineffective apps is beyond me.Literally nothing works!"
"Always nice going into the Llandudno store the staff are very friendly & helpful.I particularly like speaking to Lisa who is easy to talk to,friendly very patient and explains everything perfectly. Much better than a phone call from a faceless person"
Lovely friendly helpful service - all issues sorted with a smile. Hugely beneficial
"Our visit was very personable and informative. Your store manager, Sam, was also very helpful and thorough."
Friendly and helpful! Thank you
"Just realized that our Monthly Charge for Broadband has gone up by £4.18 a month (14% increase).  Looking at what is available in our area (USwitch) we could get a similar service for £26.00 a month. INCLUDING Vodafone as a new customer. Called VF to ask why - Annual RPI change. I pointed out to the Service Agent that VF are now for us significantly un-competitive on price and asked if anything could be done, the answer was all major providers have increase contract prices in line with RPI but we could cancel if we wished. Discovered that due to  24 months contract (12 months to go) we need to pay a cancellation fee - which is all of the fees for the remaining contract period so over £300.I would recommend prospective customers check carefully terms of contract. Beware of sharp practice with the contract, I believe this practice has been stopped for insurance - new customers and existing must be offered the same pricing model. Its a pity it does not apply to Broadband."
Mikey was brilliant and made sure we had all the information we need
Bruno was extremely helpful and talked through all the options with me to make sure I got the best deal. He was also great at talking through how to transfer all my data
ABSOLUTE HORRIBLE SERVICE. They never told the previous supplier when they changed over the service which resulted in double billing. When I called Vodafone they told me I should of notified them to do this. They never through the contract process or when the engineer was literally installing the modem told me I had to notify them even though they were obviously switching out another supplier. I called and the person who helped me said this happens all the time yet they refuse to do anything about it.
Danny made the experience very easy and explained everything very well.
Amazing assistance from Lottie who took great care to explain everything to me and update my contract. It was an excellent experience. I am very impressed and very grateful
"10/10 Customer Service!! Going into the store everyone was so helpful, especially Charlie who was so friendly and helped me upgrade my contract. Thank you so much:)"
Very efficient service.  Extremely helpful in purchasing a new phone for my elderly father.  Polite and smiley and happy. Absolute pleasure!!
Bruce was really helpful in getting my new phone sorted
Very helpful n friendly experience with an upgrade at the shop.Lisa is a credit to the team.
